## The Sequence#

Before we move onto Deployment updates, we’ll go through our usual ritual of seeing the process through a sequence diagram. We won’t repeat the explanation of the events that happened after the ReplicaSet object was created as those steps were already explained in the previous chapters.

Kubernetes client (kubectl) sent a request to the API server requesting the creation of a Deployment defined in the deploy/go-demo-2-db.yml file.

The deployment controller is watching the API server for new events, and it detected that there is a new Deployment object.

The deployment controller creates a new ReplicaSet object.
