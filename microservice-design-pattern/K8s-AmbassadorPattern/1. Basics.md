In Kubernetes, there is a container that proxy the network connection to the main container. If you like to know about its working and usage, then this document helps.

## Technical explanation
An Ambassador container is a sidecar container that is in charge of proxying connections from the application container to other services.

An ambassador service can be thought of as an out-of-process proxy that is co-located with the client. 
This pattern can be useful for offloading common client connectivity tasks such as monitoring, logging, routing, security (such as TLS).
