In Kubernetes, there is a container that proxy the network connection to the main container. If you like to know about its working and usage, then this document helps.

## Technical explanation
An Ambassador container is a sidecar container that is in charge of proxying connections from the application container to other services.

An ambassador service can be thought of as an out-of-process proxy that is co-located with the client. 
This pattern can be useful for offloading common client connectivity tasks such as monitoring, logging, routing, security (such as TLS).

## Example use
Almost all applications need a database connection at some phase. In a multi-environment place, there would be a test database, a staging database, and a production database. When writing the Pod definition for their application’s container, developers must pay attention to which database they’ll be connecting to.

Legacy application can use this pattern for its migration effort to cloud-native (micro-service)
