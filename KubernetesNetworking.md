# The Kubernetes Networking Model

Kubernetes dictates the following requirements on any networking implementation:

- all Pods can communicate with all other Pods without using network address translation (NAT).
- all Nodes can communicate with all Pods without NAT.
- the IP that a Pod sees itself as is the same IP that others see it as.

Given these constraints, we are left with four distinct networking problems to solve:

ðŸ‘‰ Container-to-Container networking

ðŸ‘‰ Pod-to-Pod networking

ðŸ‘‰ Pod-to-Service networking

ðŸ‘‰ Internet-to-Service networking
