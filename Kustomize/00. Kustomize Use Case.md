## Kustomize Use Case
Before diving into Kustomize, letâ€™s understand the problem with deploying applications using Kubernetes manifests.

### Problem Statement:
For the purpose of explanation, I am choosing a very basic example of a website frontend deployment using Nginx on Kubernetes

Suppose you want to deploy applications to Kubernetes and you have multiple environments i.e. DEV, UAT, PROD, etc. Each environment will have different parameters for Nginx deployment.

For example,

- In DEV and UAT you might need only one replica.
- In STAGING and PRODUCTION, you will have more replicas with pod autoscaling.
- The ingress routing rules will be different in each environment.
- The config and secrets will be different for each environment.

Because of the change in configs and deployment parameters for each environment, you need to maintain different Nginx deployment files for each environment. Or you will have a single deployment file and you will need to write custom shell or python scripts to replace values based on the environment.

But it is not a scalable approach.

All these issues could be resolved using Kustomize.

Also, one feature that sets it apart from other configuration tools is its tight integration with kubectl. Kustomize is now part of the kubectl utility.
