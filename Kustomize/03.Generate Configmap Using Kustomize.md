## Generate Configmap Using Kustomize

Here is the file structure of the repository. To understand the generators, we will use the generators overlay folder.

```bash
├── base
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
└── overlays
    ├── dev
    │   ├── deployment-dev.yaml
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── service-dev.yaml
    ├── generators
    │   ├── deployment.yaml
    │   ├── files
    │   │   └── index.html
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── service.yaml
    └── prod
        ├── deployment-prod.yaml
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        └── service-prod.yaml
```
Implementation available in the github repo: https://github.com/techiescamp/kustomize/blob/main/base/deployment.yaml

generators/deployment.yaml

Here is the Overlay nginx deployment.yaml that uses a configmap named index-html-configmap mounted as a volume and env variable derived from a configmap named endpoint-configmap. I have highlighted the configs in bold.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "200m"
            memory: "256Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "100m"
            memory: "128Mi"
        env:
        - name: ENDPOINT
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: endpoint-configmap
              key: endpoint
        volumeMounts:
        - name: nginx-index-file
          mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html/
      volumes:
      - name: nginx-index-file
        configMap:
          name: index-html-configmap
```

files/index.html

We have the configmap file content in the index.html file under the files directory

```html
<html>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    </br>
    <h1>Hi! This is the Configmap Index file </h1>
    </html
```
generators/kustomization.yaml

The configmap generation options should be added to the kustomization.yaml file under configMapGenerator field.

In this example, we are generating two types of Configmaps.

Configmap from a file (index.html) that will be mounted to the nginx /usr/share/nginx/html/ directory.
Configmap from literals, that will set an environment variable named ENDPOINTS
Under generatorOptions field, you can add the common labels that needs to be added to the Configmaps.

```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
- ../../base

patches:
- path: deployment.yaml
- path: service.yaml

generatorOptions:
  labels:
    app: web-service

configMapGenerator:
- name: index-html-configmap
  behavior: create
  files:
  - files/index.html
- name: endpoint-configmap
  literals:
  - endpoint="api.example.com/users"
```

Let’s run the deployment using Kustomize.

```bash
kustomize build overlays/generators | k apply  -f -
```
Now if you list the Configmaps, you can see two Configmaps created with a hash appended to their name as shown below.

```bash
kubectl get cm
```

As the deployment has a NodePort service, you can access the Nginx webpage that shows the content from the Configmap as shown below.
