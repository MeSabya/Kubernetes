### Kustomise project structure

A Kustomize project structure typically comprises a base and overlays directory. In our sample specification above, the base directory contains a file named kustomization.yaml and manifest files for shared resources.

The base/kustomization.yaml file declares the resources that Kustomize will include in all environments, while the shared manifest files define specific configurations for these resources.

The overlays directories include customization files (also named kustomization.yaml) that reference configurations within the shared manifests of the base folder and apply defined patches to build custom resources. 
The overlays directory also includes individual manifest files, which Kustomize uses to create resources specific to the environment where the files reside.

### Using Helm and Kustomize Together
Helm and Kustomize can help you manage your Kubernetes applications more efficiently. There are several scenarios where you might want to use Helm and Kustomize together, and there are:

#### When you don’t own and control the Helm chart: 
It’s common to pull and use a Helm chart somebody else published in a Helm repository. What if you want to modify something in the manifests? Kustomize makes this easy.

#### When creating Secret and ConfigMap resources: 
When working with Secrets and ConfigMaps, you obviously don’t want them baked into your Helm charts. With Kustomize, you can create the resources after Helm has inflated the charts.

#### When you want to edit fields in multiple resources simultaneously: 
In certain instances, you may want to force all (or a subset of) resources to a namespace or apply a label to these resources. You wouldn’t normally want it in your Helm charts, but Kustomize can overlay this setting over your resources.
There are two main ways to use Helm and Kustomize together, and two of them can’t be done simultaneously.

Using helm template to generate the manifests, and then Kustomize to do the patching. The downside is that Helm doesn’t manage any releases.
Using helm install (or helm upgrade --install) and having Kustomize modify the manifests before applying them in the cluster. With this method, you still benefit from Helm managing your releases and applications.
