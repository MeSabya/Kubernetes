## You are deploying an application that uses a service and an ingress. The ingress host and service type differ across environments. How can Kustomize help manage this?

Here’s how you can manage an application using a service and an ingress, with different configurations across environments using Kustomize.

### 1. Directory Structure
First, you’ll create a directory structure for Kustomize with a base configuration and specific overlays for each environment (e.g., development, staging, production).

```bash
app/
├── base/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
├── overlays/
│   ├── development/
│   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   │   └── service-patch.yaml
│   │   └── ingress-patch.yaml
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   │   └── service-patch.yaml
│   │   └── ingress-patch.yaml
│   └── production/
│       ├── kustomization.yaml
│       └── service-patch.yaml
│       └── ingress-patch.yaml
```

### 2. Base Configuration
In the base/ directory, you’ll define the common Kubernetes resources that will be used across all environments. Let’s create the following files:

##### deployment.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```
##### service.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

##### ingress.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: my-app.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-app
                port:
                  number: 80
```

##### kustomization.yaml
This file tells Kustomize which resources to manage. In the base/ directory:

```yaml
resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
  - ingress.yaml
```

### 3. Environment-Specific Overlays
In each environment overlay (e.g., development, staging, and production), you can customize specific parts of the base configuration. For example, let’s modify the Service type and Ingress host for the development environment.

##### overlays/development/service-patch.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  type: NodePort
```

This patch changes the Service type from ClusterIP (defined in the base) to NodePort for development.

##### overlays/development/ingress-patch.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: dev.my-app.example.com
```
This patch changes the Ingress host to dev.my-app.example.com for the development environment.

##### overlays/development/kustomization.yaml
In the kustomization.yaml file for the development overlay, reference the base configuration and specify the patches for the service and ingress:

```yaml
resources:
  - ../../base

patchesStrategicMerge:
  - service-patch.yaml
  - ingress-patch.yaml
```

### 4. Overlays for Other Environments
For staging and production, you’ll create similar patches to adjust the Service type and Ingress host accordingly.

##### overlays/staging/service-patch.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
```

##### overlays/staging/ingress-patch.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
    - host: staging.my-app.example.com
```
##### overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml

```yaml
resources:
  - ../../base

patchesStrategicMerge:
  - service-patch.yaml
  - ingress-patch.yaml
```
For production, you might have something similar, but with different values for the Service type and Ingress host.

### 5. Deploying to Different Environments
Once you have set up the base and overlays, you can use Kustomize to deploy your application with environment-specific configurations.

Deploy to Development

```bash
kubectl apply -k overlays/development
```
