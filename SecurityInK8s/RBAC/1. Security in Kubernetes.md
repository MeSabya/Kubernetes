1. Authentication

2. Authorization(RBAC)

3. Admission Control

>Kubernetes Authentication means validating the identity of who or what is issuing the request. For example, if you want to access a Linux box through SSH, the SSH daemon must verify that the username and password you are using for login matches an account that lives in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. For them to be Combined together, those files represent the authentication database for Linux. 


>On the other hand, authorization refers to what you are allowed to do once you gain access. So, back to our Linux example, the user can gain access to the operating system by providing valid credentials, but they cannot view or modify the contents of sensitive files like /etc/shadow. Only the root user or someone with root privileges can do this.
