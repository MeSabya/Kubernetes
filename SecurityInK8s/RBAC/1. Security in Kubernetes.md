# RBAC in Kubernetes: Demystified

Before talking about RBAC, it‚Äôs important to understand the complete picture where a user or application wants access to Kubernetes objects and then we will talk about where does RBAC fit in these stages.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33947539/148539896-7651c776-3b63-4818-89a1-c954eae3babe.png)

1. Authentication

2. Authorization(RBAC)

3. Admission Control

>Kubernetes Authentication means validating the identity of who or what is issuing the request. For example, if you want to access a Linux box through SSH, the SSH daemon must verify that the username and password you are using for login matches an account that lives in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. For them to be Combined together, those files represent the authentication database for Linux. 


>On the other hand, authorization refers to what you are allowed to do once you gain access. So, back to our Linux example, the user can gain access to the operating system by providing valid credentials, but they cannot view or modify the contents of sensitive files like /etc/shadow. Only the root user or someone with root privileges can do this.

## Users in Kubernetes
As the Kubernetes gateway, APIServer is the entrance for users to access and manage resource objects. Every access request needs a visitor legitimacy check, including verification of identity and resource operation authority, etc., then returns the access result after passing a series of verifications.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33947539/148731778-0df5c9c1-72e4-4d5a-a88d-84aa8e22186e.png)

Users can access API through kubectl commands, SDK, or sending REST requests. User and Service Account are two different ways to access the API.

## Authentication

There are couples of ways to authenticate an ordinary user:
  - **Client-side X509 Client Certs**  
  - **HTTP request**
  - **Bearer token**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33947539/148730803-0116bb51-e63d-4a87-80a3-94d8980534c3.png)

### X509 Client Certs
The workflow goes as follows: you create a certificate request, sign it through a Certificate Authority (CA) and present it to the API server during the authentication phase. The API server consults the CA server to validate the certificate and, accordingly, approves or denies the request.

To set up a client-side cert using OpenSSL:

```bash
$ (umask 077;openssl genrsa -out testuser.key 2048)
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.+++
‚Ä¶+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
# generate key O:cluster name CN: username
$ openssl req -new -key testuser.key -out testuser.csr -subj ‚Äú/0=testcluster/CN=testuser‚Äù
# sign the cert
openssl x509 -req -in testuser.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out testuser.crt -days 365
```
After generating the private keys, we now need to set the keys in the kubeconfig.

***KubeConfig***:
The kubectl command supports all the above authentication methods. It uses a kubeconfig configuration file, which is often(default) stored in ~/.kube/config, to keep the communication method with APIServer and the data required for authentication.

The file mainly contains the following items.

- **Clusters**: The cluster list, including the URL to access the API Server and the cluster‚Äôs name to which it belongs.
- **Users**: User list, including user names and authentication information when accessing API Server.
- **Contexts**: Kubelet‚Äôs usable context list comprises of a specific user name in the user list and a particular cluster name in the cluster list.
- **Current-context**: The context name currently used by Kubelet is a specific item in the context list.

üëâ Next, add the created client certs to kubeconfig.

```bash
# set kube config
$ kubectl config set-cluster testcluster ‚Äî kubeconfig=testuser ‚Äî certificate-authority=ca.crt ‚Äî embed-certs=true
# view cluster config
$ kubectl config view ‚Äî kubeconfig=testuser
```
üëâ *The next step is to set client credentials.*

$ kubectl config set-credentials testuser ‚Äî client-certificate=testuser.crt ‚Äî client-key=testuser.key ‚Äî embed-certs=true ‚Äî kubeconfig=testuser

The output of the kubeconfig is like this

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
  name: testcluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: testcluster
    user: testuser
  name: testuser@testcluster
current-context: ""
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: testuser
  user:
    client-certificate-data: REDACTED
    client-key-data: REDACTED
```
üëâ The final step is using the context.

```bash
kubectl config use-context testuser@testcluster ‚Äî kubeconfig=testuser
```

### Bearer token

- Bearer token is a static token verify method, to enable which, you need to start APIServer with token-auth-file=authfile. 
- The authfile format is like, password,user,uid,"group1,group2".Each line represents one user.

There are two ways to use Bearer token:

1. **Use HTTP header set**: 

```
curl -X "POST" "https://{kubernetes API IP}:{kubernetes API Port}/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/serviceaccounts/{name}/token" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {bearer token}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' -d $'{}'
```
2. **Use kubeconfig**:

```
# set your token in the kubeconfig
$ kubectl config set-credentials NAME [-client-certificate=path/to/certfile] [-client-key=path/to/keyfile] [-token=bearer_token] [-username=basic_user] [-password=basic_password]
# use the context
$ kubectl config use-context NAME
```

### HTTP Login

- It‚Äôs basically a username and password login method. To enable it, you need to start the APIServer with basic-auth-file=authfile.
- The authfile here is just like the one for Bearer token. Using it requires the HTTP client to add Authorization: Basic BASE64ENCODED(USER:PASSWORD) to the header to perform HTTP basic identity authentication. BASE64ENCODED(USER:PASSWORD) is USER:PASSWORD base64 value. After receiving, APIServer will judge whether the username and password are correct according to the authfile.

### Service Account:

üëâ There are two types of account in Kubernetes:

**User Account**: It is used to allow us, humans, to access the given Kube

rnetes cluster. Any user needs to get authenticated by the API server to do so. A user account can be an admin or a developer who is trying to access the cluster level resources.

**Service Account**: It is used to authenticate machine level processes to get access to our Kubernetes cluster. The API server is responsible for such authentication to the processes running in the pod.

#### Defination of Service Account**:

In the Kubernetes cluster, any processes or applications in the container which resides within the pod can access the cluster by getting authenticated by the API server, using a service account.

üëâ For Example:

An application like Prometheus accessing the cluster to monitor it is a type of service account
So,

        A service account is an identity that is attached to the processes running within a pod.

#### How Does Kubernetes Service Account Works?
##### Case 1: When you have an external application trying to access Kubernetes cluster API servers.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33947539/154813234-2d9c4c5a-ea5c-4c63-b59b-d2de4cbb5dda.png)

üëÜ My Web Page is trying to access the Kubernetes cluster

      Suppose there is a web page: My Web Page which has a list of items to be displayed, this data needs to be fetched from an API server hosted in the Kubernetes cluster as  
      shown above in the figure. To do so, we need to a service account that will be enabled by cluster API servers to authenticate and access the data from the cluster servers.

##### Case 2: When the application is hosted and running within the Cluster POD
In this scenario, when any pod is created in the Kubernetes cluster with any given namespace, these pods by default creates a service account with the name default. The default service account automatically creates the service token along with the required secret object.
So our application will be able to access the API server lying within the same namespace, by using this default service account mounted in the pod.

## Authorization

##### Authorization Methods: Node, ABAC, Webhooks, RBAC 

- Authorization defines what you can do after login.
- In traditional web systems, user management has three major parts, User, Role, Permission, which are stored in relational databases, and between which there are many-to-many mappings.
- Now people use ServiceAccount, Role, Rolebinding in the Cloud world, and all these stored in etcd.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33947539/148742689-aea50bc4-1f79-42ac-9782-4cd9c184fbd9.png)

üëâ *In Kubernetes architecture, one of the biggest advantages is the decoupling of different resources. Every resource type is independent, and they only communicate via APIServer. So API objects for different resources such as /pod/create, /service/create have become the new type of permissions, which are the real asset here.*

üëâ Then it‚Äôs the developers‚Äô job to organize all the APIs, assign them into different roles, and finally grant all these roles to ServiceAccount(user) using RoleBinding.


### RBAC

*Role-based access control (RBAC) is a way of granting users granular access to Kubernetes API resources. RBAC is a security design that restricts access to Kubernetes resources based on the role the user holds.

API Objects for configuring RBAC: Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding.

Role/ClusterRole only say what can be done, while who can do what is defined in a RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding.*

#### Role
- Role defines what can be done to Kubernetes Resources.
- Role contains one or more rules that represent a set of permissions.
- Permissions are additive. There are no deny rules.
- Roles are namespaced, meaning Roles work within the constraints of a namespace. It would default to the default namespace if none was specified.
- After creating a Role, you assign it to a user or group of users by creating a RoleBinding.

Example
Here‚Äôs an example Role in the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù namespace that can be used to grant read access to pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
#### Cluster Role:
- ClusterRole works the same as Role, but they are applied to the cluster as a whole.
- ClusterRoles are not bound to a specific namespace. ClusterRole give access across more than one namespace or all namespaces.
- After creating a ClusterRole, you assign it to a user or group of users by creating a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.
- ClusterRoles are typically used with service accounts.

Because ClusterRoles are cluster-scoped, you can use ClusterRoles to control access to different kinds of resources than you can with Roles.

          Cluster-scoped resources (e.g. Nodes, PersistentVolumes)
          Non-resource endpoints (e.g./healthz).
          Namespaced resources (e.g. Pods across the entire cluster), across all namespaces.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  # "namespace" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  #
  # at the HTTP level, the name of the resource for accessing Secret
  # objects is "secrets"
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
```
#### Role Binding:
- Role Binding is used for granting permission to a Subject.
- RoleBinding holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference to the role being granted.
- Role and RoleBinding are used in namespaced scoped.
- RoleBinding may reference any Role in the same namespace.
- After you create a binding, you cannot change the Role or ClusterRole that it refers to. If you do want to change the roleRef for a binding, you need to remove the binding object and create a replacement.
- ClusterRole and RoleBinding are used provide access to more than one namespace or the whole cluster.

**Example**

Here is an example of a RoleBinding that grants the ‚Äúpod-reader‚Äù Role to the user ‚Äújane‚Äù within the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù namespace. This allows ‚Äújane‚Äù to read pods in the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù 
namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
# You need to already have a Role named "pod-reader" in that namespace.
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
# You can specify more than one "subject"
- kind: User
  name: jane # "name" is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  # "roleRef" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```


```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This role binding allows "dave" to read secrets in the "development" namespace.
# You need to already have a ClusterRole named "secret-reader".
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-secrets
  #
  # The namespace of the RoleBinding determines where the permissions are granted.
  # This only grants permissions within the "development" namespace.
  namespace: development
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dave # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: secret-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
#### ClusterRoleBinding
- ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding function like Role and RoleBinding, except they have wider scope.
- RoleBinding grants permissions within a specific namespace, whereas a ClusterRoleBinding grants access cluster-wide and to multiple namespaces.
- ClusterRoleBinding is binding or associating a ClusterRole with a Subject (users, groups, or service accounts)

Example
To grant permissions across a whole cluster, you can use a ClusterRoleBinding. The following ClusterRoleBinding allows any user in the group ‚Äúmanager‚Äù to read secrets in any namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
# This cluster role binding allows anyone in the "manager" group to read secrets in any namespace.
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-secrets-global
subjects:
- kind: Group
  name: manager # Name is case sensitive
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: secret-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## Use Cases: What to use When?
- Use Role and a RoleBinding to scope security to a single namespace.
- Use ClusterRole and RoleBinding to scope security to several or all namespaces.
- Use ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding to scope security to all namespaces OR cluster-scoped resources.
- If you want to define a role within a namespace, use a Role; if you want to define a role cluster-wide, use a ClusterRole.

## Elements in RBAC Definition

### Subjects
Subjects are nothing but a group of users, services, or team making an attempt at Kubernetes API. It defines what operations a user, service, or a group can perform.

Users: These are global, and meant for humans or processes living outside the cluster.

Groups: Set of users.

Service Accounts: Kubernetes uses service accounts to authenticate and authorize requests by pods to the Kubernetes API server. These are namespaced and meant for intra-cluster processes running inside pods.

### Verbs
The set of operations that can be executed to the resources are called verbs. For examples, different verbs are get, watch, create, delete. Ultimately all of them are Create, Read, Update or Delete (CRUD) operations.

### Resources
The set of Kubernetes API Objects available in the cluster are called Resources. For examples, Pods, Deployments, Services, Nodes, PersistentVolumes etc.
