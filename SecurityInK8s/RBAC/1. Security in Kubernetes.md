# RBAC in Kubernetes: Demystified

Before talking about RBAC, it’s important to understand the complete picture where a user or application wants access to Kubernetes objects and then we will talk about where does RBAC fit in these stages.

1. Authentication

2. Authorization(RBAC)

3. Admission Control

>Kubernetes Authentication means validating the identity of who or what is issuing the request. For example, if you want to access a Linux box through SSH, the SSH daemon must verify that the username and password you are using for login matches an account that lives in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files. For them to be Combined together, those files represent the authentication database for Linux. 


>On the other hand, authorization refers to what you are allowed to do once you gain access. So, back to our Linux example, the user can gain access to the operating system by providing valid credentials, but they cannot view or modify the contents of sensitive files like /etc/shadow. Only the root user or someone with root privileges can do this.

## Users in Kubernetes
As the Kubernetes gateway, APIServer is the entrance for users to access and manage resource objects. Every access request needs a visitor legitimacy check, including verification of identity and resource operation authority, etc., then returns the access result after passing a series of verifications.

Users can access API through kubectl commands, SDK, or sending REST requests. User and Service Account are two different ways to access the API.

## Authentication

There are couples of ways to authenticate an ordinary user:
  - **Client-side X509 Client Certs**  
  - **HTTP request**
  - **Bearer token**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33947539/148730803-0116bb51-e63d-4a87-80a3-94d8980534c3.png)

### X509 Client Certs
The workflow goes as follows: you create a certificate request, sign it through a Certificate Authority (CA) and present it to the API server during the authentication phase. The API server consults the CA server to validate the certificate and, accordingly, approves or denies the request.

To set up a client-side cert using OpenSSL:

```bash
$ (umask 077;openssl genrsa -out testuser.key 2048)
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
………….+++
…+++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
# generate key O:cluster name CN: username
$ openssl req -new -key testuser.key -out testuser.csr -subj “/0=testcluster/CN=testuser”
# sign the cert
openssl x509 -req -in testuser.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out testuser.crt -days 365
```
After generating the private keys, we now need to set the keys in the kubeconfig.

***KubeConfig***:
The kubectl command supports all the above authentication methods. It uses a kubeconfig configuration file, which is often(default) stored in ~/.kube/config, to keep the communication method with APIServer and the data required for authentication.

The file mainly contains the following items.

- **Clusters**: The cluster list, including the URL to access the API Server and the cluster’s name to which it belongs.
- **Users**: User list, including user names and authentication information when accessing API Server.
- **Contexts**: Kubelet’s usable context list comprises of a specific user name in the user list and a particular cluster name in the cluster list.
- **Current-context**: The context name currently used by Kubelet is a specific item in the context list.

👉 Next, add the created client certs to kubeconfig.

```bash
# set kube config
$ kubectl config set-cluster testcluster — kubeconfig=testuser — certificate-authority=ca.crt — embed-certs=true
# view cluster config
$ kubectl config view — kubeconfig=testuser
```
👉 *The next step is to set client credentials.*

$ kubectl config set-credentials testuser — client-certificate=testuser.crt — client-key=testuser.key — embed-certs=true — kubeconfig=testuser

The output of the kubeconfig is like this

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED
  name: testcluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: testcluster
    user: testuser
  name: testuser@testcluster
current-context: ""
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: testuser
  user:
    client-certificate-data: REDACTED
    client-key-data: REDACTED
```
👉 The final step is using the context.

```bash
kubectl config use-context testuser@testcluster — kubeconfig=testuser
```

### Bearer token

- Bearer token is a static token verify method, to enable which, you need to start APIServer with token-auth-file=authfile. 
- The authfile format is like, password,user,uid,"group1,group2".Each line represents one user.

There are two ways to use Bearer token:

1. **Use HTTP header set**: 

```
curl -X "POST" "https://{kubernetes API IP}:{kubernetes API Port}/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/serviceaccounts/{name}/token" \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {bearer token}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' -d $'{}'
```
2. **Use kubeconfig**:

```
# set your token in the kubeconfig
$ kubectl config set-credentials NAME [-client-certificate=path/to/certfile] [-client-key=path/to/keyfile] [-token=bearer_token] [-username=basic_user] [-password=basic_password]
# use the context
$ kubectl config use-context NAME
```

### HTTP Login

- It’s basically a username and password login method. To enable it, you need to start the APIServer with basic-auth-file=authfile.
- The authfile here is just like the one for Bearer token. Using it requires the HTTP client to add Authorization: Basic BASE64ENCODED(USER:PASSWORD) to the header to perform HTTP basic identity authentication. BASE64ENCODED(USER:PASSWORD) is USER:PASSWORD base64 value. After receiving, APIServer will judge whether the username and password are correct according to the authfile.

### Service Account:

Service Account, different from the ordinary users, is one of the resources managed by Kubernetes. It can be created via API, contains a set of secrets, is stored in etcd, and is usually assigned to a namespace.

- Service Account is managed by Kubernetes API.
- Service Account applies to applications (pods) running inside the cluster.
- Service Account accesses API through bearer token authentication. It is very easy to set up a Service Account through YAML.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: test
  namespace: kube-system
```

## Authorization

##### Authorization Methods: Node, ABAC, Webhooks, RBAC 

- Authorization defines what you can do after login.
- In traditional web systems, user management has three major parts, User, Role, Permission, which are stored in relational databases, and between which there are many-to-many mappings.
- Now people use ServiceAccount, Role, Rolebinding in the Cloud world, and all these stored in etcd.

👉 *In Kubernetes architecture, one of the biggest advantages is the decoupling of different resources. Every resource type is independent, and they only communicate via APIServer. So API objects for different resources such as /pod/create, /service/create have become the new type of permissions, which are the real asset here.*

👉 Then it’s the developers’ job to organize all the APIs, assign them into different roles, and finally grant all these roles to ServiceAccount(user) using RoleBinding.


### RBAC
- RBAC belongs to rbac.authorization.k8s.io API Group
- You need to set -authorization-mode=Node,RBAC in APIServer configuration to enable dynamic RBAC function.
- Kubernetes uses namespace to add separation in resource ownership, except for cluster-wide resources. So RBAC also split into two scopes, cluster-wide and namespace-wide. - -
- ClusterRole and ClusterRolebinding are used for cluster-level resources (Nodes, PersistentVolumes, ...)
. On the other hand, Role and Rolebinding correspond to resources in the namespace.

##### The RBAC Components

>Rules, Roles, Subjects, and RoleBindings.

#### Rules

>A Rule is a set of operations (verbs), resources, and API groups. Verbs describe activities that can be performed on resources which belong to different API Groups.

RBAC uses the rbac.authorization.k8s.io group. If we’d switch to a different authorization method, we’d need to change the group as well.

#### Roles

>A Role is a collection of Rules. It defines one or more Rules that can be bound to a user or a group of users.

The vital aspect of Roles is that they are applied to a Namespace. If we’d like to create a role that refers to a whole cluster, we’d use ClusterRole instead. Both are defined in the same way, and the only difference is in the scope (Namespace or an entire cluster).

#### Subjects

>Subjects define entities that are executing operations. A Subject can be a User, a Group, or a Service Account.

#### RoleBindings

>As the name suggests, Role Bindings bind a User (or a Group, or a Service Account) to a Role (or a Cluster Role).

👉 Since Subjects define users, RoleBindings effectively bind users (or Groups or Service Accounts) to Roles, thus giving them permissions to perform certain operations on specific objects within a Namespace. Just like roles, RoleBindings have a cluster-wide alternative called ClusterRoleBindings. The only difference is that their scope is not limited to a Namespace, but applied to a whole cluster.
