# A Closer Look at Etcd: The Brain of a Kubernetes Cluster

Etcd is a crucial component for Kubernetes as it stores the entire state of the cluster: its configuration, specifications, and the statuses of the running workloads.

ðŸ‘‰ In the Kubernetes world, etcd is used as the backend for service discovery and stores the clusterâ€™s state and its configuration.

Etcd is deployed as a cluster, several nodes whose communications are handled by the Raft algorithm. In a production environment, a cluster contains an odd number of nodes and at least three are required.


## Etcd in Kubernetes

In the context of a Kubernetes cluster, etcd instances can be deployed as Pods on the masters (this is the example we will use in this post).

To add an additional level of security and resiliency it can also be deployed as an external cluster.
