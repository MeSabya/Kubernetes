Webhooks in Kubernetes are not namespaced; they are cluster-wide resources. This means that they are not confined to a specific namespace like some other resources (such as Pods or Services), but rather can be used and accessed across the entire Kubernetes cluster. When you create a webhook configuration, it applies globally within the cluster, affecting resources across namespaces as specified in its configuration.

Mutating webhook does not modify the k8s resource, but responds with a JSONPatch, telling k8s how to modify the object for us. I found this quite counter intuitive, since we’re creating a Mutating Admission Webhook but don’t actually mutate anything.

One of the useful use cases for the mutating webhook could be for operator upgrades whose CRDs have been changed.

### Challenge
When CRDs change, existing custom resources (CRs) might not immediately conform to the new schema. This can cause issues such as:

- Existing CRs being invalid under the new schema.
- The operator not recognizing or correctly handling the old CR format.
- Disruption in the application's functionality due to incompatibility between the old CRs and the new operator logic.

***Solution: Using a Mutating Webhook***

A mutating webhook can address these challenges by automatically updating existing CRs to conform to the new CRD 
schema during the upgrade process.

The mutatation webhook does the actual processing of AdmissionReview requests by …

- unmarshalling a received JSON payload into a AdmissionReview object
- using the AdmissionRequest object to decide what we should do
- creating the JSONPatch
- creating a new AdmissionResponse
- updating the AdmissionReview with our new AdmissionResponse
- marshal the finalAdmissionReview into JSON and return it

## Can you explain the webhook config file used here:

The main section to focus is :

```yaml
    clientConfig: # Defines how the kube-apiserver communicates with the hook
      # URL:: "https://some-webhook.demo.com/validate"
      service: # If the webhook is running within the cluster, then we should use service
        name: mutating-webhook
        namespace: webhook-demo
        path: "/validate"
      caBundle: ${CA_PEM_B64}
```

 ### clientConfig: Defines how the Kubernetes API server communicates with the webhook.

- URL: (Commented out) An external URL for the webhook if it's running outside the cluster. Not used in this example.
- service: Specifies that the webhook service is running within the Kubernetes cluster.
- name: The name of the service handling the webhook, here mutating-webhook.
- namespace: The namespace where the service is located, here webhook-demo.
- path: The specific path on the service to send requests, here /validate.

### rules: Specifies when the webhook should be invoked.
- operations: The operations that trigger the webhook. Here, it is CREATE.
- apiGroups: The API group of the resources. An empty string ("") refers to the core API group.
- apiVersions: The API versions of the resources. Here, it is v1.
- resources: The specific resources that trigger the webhook. Here, it is pods.

## How a Mutating Admission Webhook Works in Kubernetes: Step-by-Step

A Mutating Admission Webhook intercepts API requests (e.g., CREATE, UPDATE) sent to the Kubernetes API server and can modify (mutate) the objects in the request (like Pods) before they are persisted in etcd (Kubernetes’ data store). Here’s how the process works step by step based on the MutatingWebhookConfiguration example provided.

### Step 1: Defining the MutatingWebhookConfiguration
You define the webhook configuration in a YAML manifest and apply it to the cluster using kubectl apply -f.

This creates a MutatingWebhookConfiguration object that instructs the Kubernetes API server to trigger your webhook under certain conditions, such as when a Pod is created.

In your case, the webhook listens for CREATE operations on Pods and makes modifications to the Pod's definition (such as injecting labels or setting resource limits).

### Step 2: Kubernetes API Server Intercepts Requests
When a user or service submits a request to create a resource (like a Pod) via the Kubernetes API (kubectl create, an automated system, etc.), the API server intercepts the request before storing it in etcd.

For example, if you kubectl apply -f pod.yaml, the Kubernetes API server intercepts this operation.

### Step 3: Admission Control Flow
The Kubernetes API server has a series of admission controllers that handle requests. These include:

Validating Admission Controllers: They validate requests but don’t modify them.
Mutating Admission Controllers: These mutate requests (like your webhook).
Mutating webhooks are called before validating webhooks. If the mutating webhook allows it, the request is modified and passed to the validating webhook (or the next step).

Since you've defined a MutatingWebhookConfiguration, the API server recognizes that it needs to send the Pod creation request to the webhook service defined in your configuration.

### Step 4: Webhook Service is Invoked
The API server sends the intercepted request to the webhook service. In your configuration:

- The service mutating-admission-demo is located in the kube-system namespace.
- The API server makes an HTTP call to the /mutate endpoint of this service.
- The webhook receives the request payload, which includes the Pod object the user wanted to create. The payload is wrapped in an AdmissionReview object, which contains the resource's current state.

Sample payload sent by the API server:

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "admission.k8s.io/v1",
  "kind": "AdmissionReview",
  "request": {
    "uid": "abcd-1234",
    "kind": {"group": "", "version": "v1", "kind": "Pod"},
    "operation": "CREATE",
    "object": {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "my-app",
        "namespace": "default"
      },
      "spec": {
        "containers": [...]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Step 5: Webhook Service Mutates the Object
The webhook service receives the API server's request and can perform the following tasks:

- Inspect the incoming object (e.g., Pod) to determine what changes to make.
- Mutate the object (e.g., adding labels, setting resource requests/limits, injecting sidecars).
- Return a JSONPatch response to the API server with the changes to apply.

Here is what happens inside the webhook (using the mutate logic in Python or Go):

- The webhook looks at the incoming Pod.
- It constructs a JSON patch, a set of instructions to modify the object.
- The patch is then encoded and sent back to the API server as part of the response.

Example of a patch returned by the webhook:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "uid": "abcd-1234",
    "allowed": true,
    "patchType": "JSONPatch",
    "patch": "W3sib3AiOiJhZGQiLCJwYXRoIjoiL3NwZWMvY29udGFpbmVycy8wL3Jlc291cmNlcy9saW1pdHMiLCJ2YWx1ZSI6eyJtZW1vcnkiOnsicmVxdWVzdCI6IjE2TWkiLCJsaW1pdCI6IjI1TWkifX19XQ=="
  }
}
```
This patch adds or changes values in the Pod object.

### Step 6: API Server Applies the Patch
Once the API server receives the response from the webhook service:

It decodes the patch and applies the changes to the object (e.g., Pod).
After applying the mutation, it continues to the next step in the admission control process (e.g., validating admission webhooks).
If all admission controllers approve the request, the object is persisted in etcd and the Pod is created with the mutations applied.
