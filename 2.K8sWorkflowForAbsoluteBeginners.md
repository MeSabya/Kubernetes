# Kubernetes Workflow for Absolute Beginners
1. The request is authenticated first and validated.
2. The **“kube-api-server”** creates a POD object, without assigning it to a node, updates the information of the newly created pod in “ETCD Cluster” and updated/shows us a message that a POD is got created.
3. The **“kube-scheduler”** which is continually monitoring the “kube-api-server” gets to know that a new pod is got created with no node assigned to it.
4. The **“kube-scheduler”** identifies the right node (according to pod resource requirement, pod/node affinity rules, labels & selectors etc.) to place the new POD and communicate back to the “kube-api-server” (with the information of the right node for the pod)
5. The **“kube-api-server”** again updates the information to the “ETCD Cluster” received from “kube-scheduler”.
6. The **“kube-api-server”** then passed the same information to the “kubelet” on the appropriate worker node identified by “kube-scheduler” in the 4th step.
7. The **“kubelet”** then creates the pod on node and instructs the “Container Runtime Engine” to deploy the application image/container.
8. Once done, the **“kubelet”** updates the information/status of the pod back to the “kube-api-server”.
9. And **“kube-api-server”** updates the information/data back in the “ETCD Cluster”.'

***And that’s how a pod is got created.***
