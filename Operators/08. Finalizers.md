## What is a Finalizer?
- A finalizer is a special metadata field in a Kubernetes resource that tells the API server:
- “Wait! Before you actually delete this resource, let my controller clean up something first.”
- It’s like putting a sticky note on a file: “Don’t throw this away until Bob reads it.”


- Finalizers are a way to delay the deletion of a Kubernetes resource until specific cleanup tasks are done.
- For example, if a controller wants to clean up external resources (e.g., cloud storage, load balancers, etc.),
  it adds a finalizer to the resource. The deletion is blocked until the finalizer is removed.

## Why is it Useful?
By default, when you run:

```bash
kubectl delete myresource
```
***Kubernetes deletes the resource immediately. But what if:***
- That resource controls other resources?
- It owns external systems (like AWS resources)?
- You need to do cleanup logic before it disappears?
This is where finalizers shine.

## How Does it Work?
You add a finalizer string to the **.metadata.finalizers** list of a resource.

#### When you delete the resource:

- Kubernetes sets deletionTimestamp.
- But the resource remains visible until all finalizers are removed.
- Your controller notices the deletionTimestamp, performs cleanup, and removes the finalizer.
- Only after the finalizers list is empty, the resource is deleted for real.

## Example Finalizer

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
  finalizers:
    - finalizer.cleanup.kubernetes.io
```

## Realtime example:
Consider a scenario where you want to ensure that a ConfigMap resource is not deleted until all associated Pods referencing it have been terminated. 
By adding a custom finalizer to the ConfigMap, you can orchestrate a controller to validate the termination status of associated Pods before allowing the ConfigMap deletion.

### Goal:
Prevent a ConfigMap from being deleted until all Pods using it are terminated, using a finalizer + custom controller built with Kubebuilder.
