## ObservedGeneration Vs Revision
### Key Concepts

#### Spec and Generation:

Each Custom Resource (CR) has a spec field that defines the desired state of the resource. For example, this might include configurations, replicas, or specific settings for an application.
Kubernetes automatically assigns a generation number to the spec that increments each time the spec is updated.

#### Reconciliation Loop:

Operators implement a reconciliation loop, a continuous process where they compare the current state of the cluster with the desired state defined in the spec.
When an operator detects that the spec has changed (i.e., the generation has been incremented), it performs actions to reconcile the actual state to match the desired state.

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: webapps.mycompany.com
spec:
  group: mycompany.com
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                replicas:
                  type: integer
                image:
                  type: string
            status:
              type: object
              properties:
                observedGeneration:
                  type: integer
                replicas:
                  type: integer
                conditions:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    type: string
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: webapps
    singular: webapp
    kind: WebApp
```

### 1. Initial State:

A user creates a WebApp custom resource with the following spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: mycompany.com/v1
kind: WebApp
metadata:
  name: my-webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  image: "my-webapp:latest"
```

The generation for this resource is set to 1.

### 2. Operator Watches for Changes:

The operator continuously watches for changes to WebApp resources.
When the operator observes the creation of my-webapp, it records its state and updates the status, including observedGeneration: 1.

### 3. Update Spec:

The user later updates the WebApp to change the number of replicas:

```yaml
apiVersion: mycompany.com/v1
kind: WebApp
metadata:
  name: my-webapp
spec:
  replicas: 5   # Changed from 3 to 5
  image: "my-webapp:latest"
```

This update increments the generation to 2.

### 4. Operator Detects Change:
The operator's reconciliation loop detects that the spec has changed because the generation number has changed from 1 to 2.

## Summary
In this example:

- The operator's reconciliation logic is triggered when it detects that the spec's generation has changed.
- The operator then carries out the necessary actions to reconcile the actual state (number of Pods running) with the desired state (as defined in the spec).
- Finally, it updates the observedGeneration in the status to reflect that it has processed the latest desired state.

## revision is already there , why  ObservedGeneration needed. Purpose and Use Cases
### ObservedGeneration:

- Specific to Custom Resources (CRs): ObservedGeneration is primarily used in the status of Custom Resources managed by operators. It indicates whether the operator has successfully processed the latest changes to the spec of the resource.
- Operational Status Tracking: It allows operators to track the reconciliation status of a resource. If ObservedGeneration is less than the current generation, it indicates that the operator has not yet reconciled the latest changes. This is crucial for ensuring that the actual state of the resource reflects its desired state as defined in the spec.
- Indicates Progress: It is a direct indicator of the operational state of the Custom Resource, allowing users and operators to quickly understand if changes have been applied.

### Revision:
- Versioning for All Kubernetes Resources: The revision number is a low-level concept that applies to all Kubernetes resources, including both built-in resources and Custom Resources. It tracks the state of the entire resource lifecycle (create, update, delete) in etcd.
- Tracking Historical States: It allows Kubernetes to manage and retrieve the history of resource changes, enabling functionality like watches, rollbacks, and change detection.
- Consistency in Distributed Systems: The revision mechanism helps maintain consistency across distributed systems by ensuring that updates are tracked and can be managed appropriately, especially in scenarios involving multiple clients or controllers.
