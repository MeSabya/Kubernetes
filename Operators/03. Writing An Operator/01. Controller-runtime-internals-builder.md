The primary purpose of the Builder component is to create a controller from a given Reconciler, bind it with the specified manager and target resources.

How Builder is used
Hereâ€™s an example of the usage of Builder:

```golang
err = builder.
  ControllerManagedBy(mgr).  // Initialize the builder with the given manager
  For(&appsv1.ReplicaSet{}). // Specify the resource type to be watched
  Owns(&corev1.Pod{}).       // Specify the resource type that is owned by the ReplicaSet
  Complete(&ReplicaSetReconciler{})
```
ðŸ‘‰ The For, Owns, or Watches functions are used to specify the target resources, changes of which trigger the reconciliation logic.

The Complete or Build function is called in the final step to complete the building process. 
It takes a Reconciler as an argument to create a controller from the given Reconciler internally and bind it with the 
configured manager and target resources.

## For and Owns Explanation 

In the provided code snippet, For and Owns are methods used to configure the behavior of the controller built using the builder object. Let me explain each one:

### For(&alpha1v1.Foo{}):

The For method is used to specify the Kubernetes resource type that the controller will watch for changes. In this case, it specifies that the controller will watch for changes to resources of type alpha1v1.Foo{}.
When the controller is created, it will be configured to watch for events related to the specified resource type (alpha1v1.Foo{}). This means that the controller will reconcile instances of alpha1v1.Foo{} whenever they are created, updated, or deleted in the Kubernetes cluster.

### Owns(&corev1.Pod{}):

The Owns method is used to specify that the controller will also manage resources that are owned by instances of the resource type specified in the For method.
In this case, it specifies that the controller will also manage resources of type corev1.Pod{} that are owned by instances of alpha1v1.Foo{}. This means that when an instance of alpha1v1.Foo{} is created or updated, the controller will ensure that any associated corev1.Pod{} resources are also reconciled as needed.
The Owns method is often used to establish parent-child relationships between resources and ensure that related resources are managed consistently by the controller.

In summary, the For method specifies the primary resource type that the controller will watch, while the Owns method specifies additional resource types that are owned by instances of the primary resource type and should also be managed by the controller. Together, these methods allow you to configure the behavior of the controller and define the scope of the resources it will reconcile.

## Complete and Build Explanation 

### Complete():

The Complete() method is used to finalize the configuration of a controller. It is typically called after configuring the controller with methods like For(), Owns(), and others.
This method is used to complete the setup of the controller by providing a reconciler or handler function that defines the reconciliation logic for the controller.
The Complete() method takes a reconciler or handler function as an argument and returns an error if there is any issue finalizing the controller setup.

### Build():

The Build() method is not a standard method in the controller-runtime library, but it may be used in custom controller-building logic.
In some cases, developers may use Build() to assemble and construct the controller object after configuring its various components.
This method is not a standard part of the controller-runtime library, and its implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of the controller being built.

In summary, Complete() is typically used to finalize the configuration of a controller by providing a reconciler or handler function, while Build() may be used in custom controller-building logic to assemble and construct the controller object. These methods are commonly used when creating controllers with the controller-runtime library to define their behavior and reconcile logic.
