# controller-runtime component — Controller
The Controller component plays a crucial role in monitoring changes to the target resources on the Kubernetes API server and 
involving the Reconcile function in the Reconciler.

The process involves the following steps:

- Detecting changes in the target objects via the Kubernetes API.
- Calling the Reconcile function in the Reconciler when necessary.
- Within the Reconcile function, the Reconciler retrieves the latest status of the target object (possibly from the cache) and updates it if required.
- The Builder component initializes the Controller with the designated target resources and Reconciler, and then registers the Controller with the given Manager.
- Finally, when the Manager’s Start function is triggered, it starts the registered Controllers.
