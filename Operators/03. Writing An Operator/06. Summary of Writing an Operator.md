## 1. Scaffold Your Operator Project

Use Kubebuilder to scaffold your operator project.

```bash
kubebuilder init --domain <your-domain> --repo <your-repo>
```
This will create the basic folder structure for your operator.

## 2. Define Custom Resource (CRD)
Define the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) for your operator.
Create a new API version and kind for your CRD.

```bash
kubebuilder create api --group <group> --version <version> --kind <Kind>
```

- This creates the Go struct for your CRD's spec and status, along with the necessary Kubernetes API registration logic.
- Define the spec and status fields for your CRD. The spec contains the desired state, and the status will hold the observed state.

Example spec and status:

```go
type FooSpec struct {
    Replicas int32 `json:"replicas"`
}

type FooStatus struct {
    Replicas int32 `json:"replicas"`
    Ready    bool  `json:"ready"`
}
```
## 3. Define the Controller Logic (Reconciler)
Create a reconciler (the core logic) to manage the resources.

The reconciler is responsible for observing the state of the resources, comparing it with the desired state, and taking action to reconcile any differences.

Implement the Reconcile method in your reconciler. It will:

Retrieve the current state of the resource (using the manager’s client).
Compare the observed state with the desired state from the CRD’s spec.
Take necessary actions (e.g., create, update, or delete Kubernetes resources).

Example:

```go
func (r *FooReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
    // Fetch the Foo instance
    var foo tutorialv1.Foo
    if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, &foo); err != nil {
        log.Error(err, "unable to fetch Foo")
        return ctrl.Result{}, err
    }

    // Check if the Foo resource is in the desired state, e.g., creating a pod or updating replicas
    if foo.Spec.Replicas != foo.Status.Replicas {
        // Take action, e.g., create/update resources or scale deployments
    }

    return ctrl.Result{}, nil
}
```
## 4. Set Up the Manager
The manager is the core component that integrates all controllers and related components. It’s responsible for handling leader election, metrics collection, webhooks, and managing resources.

Set up the manager with the necessary configuration:

- Client: To interact with the Kubernetes API server.
- Scheme: To define the types the operator will manage (including your CRDs).
- Health Checks: To ensure the operator is healthy.
- Metrics Server: For collecting operator metrics.

Example:

```go
mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(ctrl.GetConfigOrDie(), ctrl.Options{
    Scheme: scheme,
    Metrics: metricsServerOptions,
    HealthProbeBindAddress: probeAddr,
    LeaderElection: enableLeaderElection,
    LeaderElectionID: "my-operator-leader-election",
})
```

## 5. Set Up the Controller

- Register your controller with the manager. This step connects your reconciler to the manager.
- Use Watches to react to changes in other resources (e.g., Pods, Deployments) that your operator may depend on.

Example:

```go
if err := (&controller.FooReconciler{
    Client: mgr.GetClient(),
    Scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),
}).SetupWithManager(mgr); err != nil {
    setupLog.Error(err, "unable to create controller", "controller", "Foo")
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

Watches: You can set up a watch to track changes to Kubernetes resources (e.g., Pods) and trigger reconciliations when they change. Example:

### Explain Client and Scheme here
<details>
	<summary>Answer me </summary>
 mgr.GetClient(): This retrieves the manager’s client, which is responsible for interacting with Kubernetes resources (such as Pods, Deployments, and CRDs)

mgr.GetScheme(): This retrieves the scheme that has been set up for the operator. This scheme contains the types of objects the operator is allowed to manage (including custom resources defined by CRDs).

### Detail explanation of SetupWithManager()

<details>
  <Summary>Answer</Summary>
  ```golang
  func (r *FooReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
	return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
		For(&tutorialv1.Foo{}).
		Watches(
			&corev1.Pod{},
			handler.EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc(r.mapPodsReqToFooReq),
		).
		Complete(r) 
```
  
This code snippet is from the SetupWithManager function of a Kubernetes operator, which is responsible for setting up the reconciliation logic and defining how the operator will interact with the resources it manages (in this case, a custom resource Foo).

Let’s break it down step by step:

#### 1. SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error
This method is typically part of a reconciler (e.g., FooReconciler). The purpose of SetupWithManager is to define the controller logic, associate it with the Manager, and specify the resources to watch and reconcile.

mgr is a ctrl.Manager instance, which is the main control loop of the operator. It manages various components of the operator, such as the controllers, webhooks, and client connections.
This function returns an error, indicating whether setting up the controller was successful.

#### 2. ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr)
This function creates a new controller that will be managed by the given mgr (manager). It is used to register and manage a controller’s lifecycle within the operator.

The controller is responsible for managing a particular resource type, reacting to changes, and triggering reconciliation logic.
mgr is the Kubernetes controller-runtime manager, which runs the controller.

####3. For(&tutorialv1.Foo{})
This line specifies that the controller will manage the Foo custom resource (CR). It tells the controller to watch for changes in the Foo resources defined in your CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

tutorialv1.Foo{} refers to the Foo resource defined under the tutorialv1 API group and version. It could look like this in the CRD:

```go
type Foo struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
    Spec   FooSpec   `json:"spec"`
    Status FooStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}
```
#### 4. Watches(&corev1.Pod{}, handler.EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc(r.mapPodsReqToFooReq))
This line adds a watch on Pods (corev1.Pod{}). This means the operator will observe all changes to Pods in the cluster.

handler.EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc(r.mapPodsReqToFooReq) is a function that specifies how the operator should handle events from the watched resource (Pods in this case).

Watches are used when you want to react to changes in other resources (besides the custom resource Foo). In this case, it watches Pods.
r.mapPodsReqToFooReq is a map function (handler) that converts a change in Pods into a reconciliation request for the Foo resource. Whenever a Pod is added, updated, or deleted, this handler maps the Pod event into a reconciliation request for one or more Foo resources.
How EnqueueRequestsFromMapFunc works:

This function is a callback that takes a Pod event and maps it to a Foo reconciliation request.

It typically looks something like this:

```go
func (r *FooReconciler) mapPodsReqToFooReq(obj client.Object) []reconcile.Request {
    // Logic to map Pod event to Foo reconciliation requests
    // This might involve identifying which Foo resources are related to the Pod
    return []reconcile.Request{
        {NamespacedName: client.ObjectKey{Name: "foo-name", Namespace: "foo-namespace"}},
    }
}
```
The map function decides which Foo resources should be reconciled based on the Pod event.

## 6. Webhooks (Optional)
If your operator needs to validate or mutate resources, set up webhooks (such as Mutating or Validating Admission Webhooks).

Webhooks can be registered with the manager in the ctrl.Options:

```go
webhookServer := webhook.NewServer(webhook.Options{TLSOpts: tlsOpts})
mgr, err := ctrl.NewManager(ctrl.GetConfigOrDie(), ctrl.Options{
    WebhookServer: webhookServer,
})
```
## 8. Run the Manager
Start the manager to begin running the operator and its controllers.
The manager will start handling resource changes and triggering the reconciliation logic.
Example:

```go
if err := mgr.Start(ctrl.SetupSignalHandler()); err != nil {
    setupLog.Error(err, "problem running manager")
    os.Exit(1)
}
```

## 9. Testing and Debugging

Write tests for your operator to ensure that it behaves correctly when resources are created, updated, or deleted.
Test edge cases, error handling, and resource interactions (e.g., when dependencies are unavailable).
Example test:

go
Copy code
func TestReconcile(t *testing.T) {
    // Set up a test environment
    // Create a Foo resource
    // Trigger reconciliation and verify the expected outcome
}

## 10. Optional: Leader Election and High Availability
If you’re running multiple replicas of the operator for high availability, enable leader election in the manager options.
The leader election ensures that only one replica is active at a time and prevents multiple instances from performing redundant work.
Example:

```go
LeaderElection: true,
LeaderElectionID: "my-operator-leader-election",
```

## Summary of Key Components:

- CRD: Defines the custom resource the operator will manage.
- Reconciler: Contains the business logic to reconcile the resource.
- Manager: Orchestrates the components, handles client access, leader election, health checks, and webhooks.
- Controller: Watches for changes to resources and triggers reconciliation.
- Webhook: Optional, used for validating and mutating resources.
- Metrics: Optional, used for monitoring operator health and performance.

Final Flow:
- Kubebuilder Scaffold initializes your operator project.
- Define CRDs to represent the resources your operator manages.
- Write the Reconciler to define the logic that brings the current state to the desired state.
- Set up the Manager to handle all controller interactions and Kubernetes API client management.
- Register the Controller and any optional webhooks with the manager.
- Run the Manager to start the operator, which begins reconciling resources.
- With these steps, you have a fully functional Kubernetes operator ready to manage custom resources and integrate with the Kubernetes ecosystem!
