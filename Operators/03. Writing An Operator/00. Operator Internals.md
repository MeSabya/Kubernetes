Operators solve this problem by making our application first class Kubernetes objects that is we no longer deploy our application as a set of native 
Kubernetes objects but a custom object/resource of its kind, having a more domain-specific schema and then we bake the “operational intelligence” or 
the “domain-specific knowledge” into the controller responsible for maintaining the desired state of this object. For example, etcd operator has made 
etcd-cluster a first class object and for deploying the cluster we create an object of Etcd Cluster kind. With operators, we are able to extend Kubernetes 
functionalities for custom use cases and manage our applications in a Kubernetes specific way allowing us to leverage Kubernetes APIs and Kubectl tooling.

Operators combine crds and custom controllers and intend to eliminate the requirement for manual intervention (human operator) while performing tasks 
like an upgrade, handling failure recovery, scaling in case of complex (often stateful) applications and make them more resilient and self-sufficient.

## Types of Operators
Currently there are three different types of operator we can build:

### Helm based operators: 
Helm based operators allow us to use our existing Helm charts and build operators using them. Helm based operators are quite easy to build and are preferred to deploy a 
stateless application using operator pattern.

### Ansible based Operator: 
Ansible based operator allows us to use our existing ansible playbooks and roles and build operators using them. 
There are also easy to build and generally preferred for stateless applications.

### Go based operators: 
Go based operators are built to solve the most complex use cases and are generally preferred for stateful applications. 
In case of an golang based operator, we build the controller logic ourselves providing it with all our custom requirements. 
This type of operators is also relatively complex to build.

# How to write an operator 
You could either build an operator from scratch using the controller-runtime project developed by Kubernetes or you could use one of the most 
popular frameworks to accelerate your development cycle and reduce the complexity ***(Kubebuilder or OperatorSDK)***.

## Operator Internals 
An operator is made of two components, a custom resource definition (CRD) and a controller.
A CRD is a “Kubernetes custom type” or a blueprint of the resource, used to describe its specification and status. 
We can define instances of the CRD, called custom resources (or CR).

**The controller (also called the control loop) continuously monitors the state of the cluster and, depending on events, makes changes. 
Its goal is to bring the current state of a resource towards its desired state, defined by the user in the specification of the custom resource.**

### Controller-runtime internals 
The sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime package consists of several key components that are commonly used when building Kubernetes controllers in Go:

- Manager
- Controller
- Reconciler
- Client
- Cache
- Webhook

Manager, Builder, and Reconciler are three important components (highlighted in the diagram) to implement a Kubernetes controller with controller-runtime.

1. Reconciler is a component to implement a core reconciliation logic.

2. The Reconciler is registered to a Manager, a component to start up the all registered controller with necessary component, such as client.

3. When registering a Reconciler, we use Builder, with which we can also specify the target resource of the Reconciler. e.g. Pod, Deployment, or your own custom resource, etc.

Additionally, threre are several more components that we don’t directly touch but are internally used:

1. Controller is started by the Manager, and when starting, it starts Source, a component that watches changes of the target resources and transmit the information to WorkQueue. Controller subscribes to the WorkQueue to get a Kubernetes object, to which the reconciliation logic is applied.

2. Client is a component that interacts with API server. Client is initialized with a Manager in another component called Cluster. The initialized client is shared among the registered controllers. The client is passed to each Reconciler so it can update Kubernetes objects to complete the reconciliation logic.

### controller-runtime component — Manager

In simple terms, the main role of the Manager is to manage the lifecycle of a set of controllers, which is why it’s called the Manager.
But what does it mean to “manage controllers?” There are three main aspects to this:

1. Managing the lifecycle of controllers, including the registration of controllers, starting and stopping each controller, and more.
2. Providing access to shared resources that are used by the controllers, such as the Kubernetes API server client, cache, event recorder, and more.
3. Managing leader election for the controllers to ensure high availability.

👉 Manager is an interface. controllerManager implements Manager interface.it has cluster and runnables.

👉 cluster has the shared resources, such as client to Kubernetes API server, cache, schema, etc. cluster is initialized in Manager.New function.

👉 runnables has four types Webhooks, Caches, LeaderElection, and Others.

👉To bind Manager with Controller, we need a builder.

👉NewControllerManagedBy is used to set the manager to a builder, with which new controller is registered to the manager. The controller is registered to runnables.Others.

👉Start() starts all the registered runnables in the controllerManager.

### How is a manager used?

##### As we’ve seen in the simple example in the first episode of this series, a Manager is initialized with NewManager

```golang
manager, err := ctrl.NewManager(ctrl.GetConfigOrDie(), ctrl.Options{})
```

##### Then, manager is passed to a builder using NewControllerManagedBy and a controller is registered internally.

```golang
err = ctrl.
  NewControllerManagedBy(manager). // Create the Controller
  For(&appsv1.ReplicaSet{}).       // ReplicaSet is the Application API
  Owns(&corev1.Pod{}).             // ReplicaSet owns Pods created by it
  Complete(&ReplicaSetReconciler{Client: manager.GetClient()})
```

##### Lastly, manager starts all the registered controllers:

```golang
manager.Start(ctrl.SetupSignalHandler())
```
