## Demystifying the For vs Owns vs Watches
Itâ€™s about difference between For() , Owns() and Watches() controller builders whenever a controller is registered withSetupWithManager .

If you pay attention to the magically auto-generated code by kubebuilder, youâ€™d see that for the controller you are writing, 
there would be a method defined like this

```go
func (r *MyController) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
	return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
		For(&corev1alpha1.MyCustomResource{}).
		Complete(r)
}
```

### For keyword
Letâ€™s take a look at theFor keyword. If you had asked me when I read this method first time, 
I would have easily guessed that the MyControlleris being hooked to reconcile against the MyCustomResource{} type. 
So, any create/update/delete happening with a MyCustomResource object in the cluster would trigger the Reconcile() method of MyController .

***But what if MyController is not thaatt simple. 
What if itâ€™s one heck of a complicated controller which is creating and owning other resources like Pods and trying to watch and reconcile them as well.***

### Letâ€™s work with an example
Letâ€™s consider our sweet MyController . This controller is special and a bit crazy. What it does is that whenever aMyCustomResource 
object is created in the cluster, it creates annginx:latest pod with the labels foo: bar . But this controller is very nitpicky. 
It doesnâ€™t want any add/update/delete happening to the labels ofthis pod.

ðŸ‘‰ This means that our controller wants to watch these pods and fix them whenever their labels are changed from foo: bar .

#### how can we do that?

Our Reconcile Method would take the following steps to do so:

- Get the MyCustomResourceobject, exit if it IsNotFound. Else,
- Get the name and namespace of that object.
- Create a nginx:latest pod with the same name and namespace, and labels foo: bar

```golang
func (r *MyController) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
  // Get the MyCustomResource being reconciled here
  myCustomResource := corev1alpha1.MyCustomResource{}
  if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, &mycustomResource); err != nil {
    // ignore the error if it corresponds to MyCustomResource not found. 
    return ctrl.Result{}, client.IgnoreNotFound(err)
  }
  
  // fetch the name and namespace of MyCustomResource
  name, namespace := myCustomResource.Name, myCustomResource.Namespace
  labels := map[string]string{
    "foo": "bar",
  }
  
  // pod to be created
  desiredPod := corev1.Pod{
    ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
      Name: name,
      Namespace: namespace,
      Labels: labels,
    },
    Spec: corev1.PodSpec{
      Containers: []corev1.Container{
        {
          Image: "nginx:latest",
          Name: "nginx-container",
        },
      },
    },
  }
  
  // let's create the pod and be done with reconciliation
  return ctrl.Result{}, r.Create(ctx, &desiredPod)
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ The above Reconcile()method will be triggered whenever a create/update/delete would happen with a MyCustomResource .

### But does this mean that our MyController needs to watch every Pod in the cluster?

Nope, MyController only cares about the pods it creates and doesnâ€™t care about any other ad-hoc pods.

So, how do we encode some information in the child pods conveying that they were created by MyController

ðŸ‘‰ OwnerReferences!

Just prior to creating the Pod, the MyController can attach an ownerReference to the Pod with the owner being the MyCustomResource which is the parent of that Pod.

We do this the following way:

```golang
func (r *MyController) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
 myCustomResource := corev1alpha1.MyCustomResource{}
 ....
 ....
  // pod to be created
  desiredPod := corev1.Pod{
    ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{...},
    Spec: corev1.PodSpec{...},
  }
  
  // set MyCustomResource as the owner of the above pod
  if err := controllerutil.SetControllerReference(&myCustomResource, &desiredPod, r.Scheme); err != nil {
      return ctrl.Result{}, err
  }

  // let's create the pod containing the ownerReference and be done with reconciliation
  return ctrl.Result{}, r.Create(ctx, &desiredPod)
}
```

With this code, any Pod which will be created from the Reconcile() method would look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    name: somename
    namespace: somenamespace
    labels:
      foo: bar
    ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: yash.com/v1alpha1
      controller: true
      kind: MyCustomResource
      name: <metadata.name of the owner mycustomresource>
      uid: <metadata.uid of the owner mycustomeresource>
spec:
     containers:
     - image: nginx:latest
       name: nginx-container
```

But this ainâ€™t enough
The above code is just setting the MyCustomResource as the owner of the Pod. 
What we want is that whenever one of such pods is fiddled with, the above reconciliation loop is retriggered against that podâ€™s owner MyCustomResource .

And we achieve that with Owns() under the SetupWithManager method.

So, the SetupWithManager method would look like this:

```golang
func (r *MyController) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
	return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
		For(&corev1alpha1.MyCustomResource{}).
		Owns(&corev1.Pod{}).  // trigger the r.Reconcile whenever an Own-ed pod is created/updated/deleted
		Complete(r)
}
```
The Owns(&corev1.Pod{}) is telling the manager to trigger MyController â€˜s Reconcile()not only when MyCustomResource is fiddled with but also when any Pod with an ownerReference to a MyCustomResource is created/updated/deleted.


***We need the piece of code in our Reconcile() 
method to NOT blindly create the Pod but check for its existence and labels first and only then, create/update the Pod accordingly.***

```golang
func (r *MyController) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
  // Get the MyCustomResource being reconciled here
  myCustomResource := corev1alpha1.MyCustomResource{}
  if err := r.Get(ctx, req.NamespacedName, &mycustomResource); err != nil {
    // ignore the error if it corresponds to MyCustomResource not found. 
    return ctrl.Result{}, client.IgnoreNotFound(err)
  }
  
  // fetch the name and namespace of MyCustomResource
  name, namespace := myCustomResource.Name, myCustomResource.Namespace
  labels := map[string]string{
    "foo": "bar",
  }
  
  // desired pod to end up in the cluster
  desiredPod := corev1.Pod{
    ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{
      Name: name,
      Namespace: namespace,
      Labels: labels,
    },
    Spec: corev1.PodSpec{
      Containers: []corev1.Container{
        {
          Image: "nginx:latest",
          Name: "nginx-container",
        },
      },
    },
  }
  
  // first let's check if it already exists
  foundPod := &corev1.Pod{}
  if err := r.Get(ctx, client.ObjectKeyFromObject(&desiredPod), &foundPod); err != nil {
    // create the desired pod if the pod doesn't exist already
    if errors.IsNotFound(err) {
      return ctrl.Result{}, r.Create(ctx, &desiredPod)
    }
    return ctrl.Result{}, err
  }
  
  // pod was found
  // validate the labels of the found pod
  expectedLabels := map[string]string{
    "foo": "bar",
  }
  foundLabels := foundPod.Labels
  // if the foundLabels match the expectedLabels, no need to do anything: just exit peacefully
  if reflect.DeepEqual(expectedLabels, foundLabels) {
    return ctrl.Result{}, nil
  }
  
  // else, update the foundPod with expectedLabels
  foundPod.Labels = expectedLabels
  return ctrl.Result{}, r.Update(ctx, foundPod)
}
```
### Summary on For and own

- For(<ownerType>) â€” Tells the manager to trigger the Reconcile(...) whenever any object of <ownerType> is created/updated/deleted
- Owns(<childType>) â€” Tells the manager to trigger the Reconcile(...) whenever any object of <childType> having an ownerReference to <ownerType> is created/updated/deleted.

## But why do we need Watches() if we already have For() and Owns() ?

With it, you can configure any possible event happening in the cluster to trigger the controllerâ€™s Reconcile() method.

Heck! You can even trigger the controllerâ€™s Reconcile() method for some outside-the-cluster event happening like some webhook getting triggered or just the clock hitting 12:00 AM at the night.

The method signature for Watches() looks like this:

```golang
Watches(source.Source, handler.EventHandler, ...)
```

ðŸ‘‰ source.Source â€” represents what will be the source of the event which will trigger the reconciliation loop. Say, 
    if you wanna trigger the reconciliation loop anytime a ConfigMap is created, youâ€™d define it as Watches(&source.Kind{Type: &corev1.ConfigMap{}}, ..., ...)

ðŸ‘‰ handler.EventHandler â€” represents which request will be exactly triggered (enqueued) against the Reconcile(req ctrl.Request) method. 
  controller-runtime already provides us with readymade eventHandlers like handler.EnqueueRequestForObject{} which enqueues a request containing the 
  Name/Namespace of the source of the event. For example, Watches(&source.Kind{Type: &corev1.ConfigMap{}}, &handler.EnqueueRequestForObject{}, ...) 
  would trigger a Request whenever a configMap is created/updated/deleted and that request would contain the name/namespace of that configmap 
  triggering the request.

### Letâ€™s play with a fun example

Say, I want to trigger a reconciliation loop for the MyCustomResource with the name foo in the default namespace every night at 12:00AM

We can easily do that with Watches() with source.Channel under the SetupWithManager method itself. The following code achieves that:

```golang
func (r *MyController) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error {
  // channel which will act as the source for reconciliation
  reconciliationSourceChannel := make(chan event.GenericEvent)
  
  // running the time checker as a goroutine
  // this goroutine will periodically check the local time and trigger a reconciliation via the above channel at 12:00AM 
  // for MyCustomResource with name: "foo" and namespace: "default"
	go func() {
		// every 45 seconds, run the time-check and trigger an event if the time is 12:00AM
		ticker := time.NewTicker(45 * time.Second)
		defer ticker.Stop()
		for _ = range ticker.C {
			now := time.Now()
			// if 12:00AM, trigger the reconciliation by firing a Generic event against the channel registered as a source to `Watches()` containing the object to reconcile
			if now.Local().Hour() == 0 && now.Local().Minute() == 0 {
				object := corev1alpha1.MyCustomResource{ObjectMeta: metav1.ObjectMeta{Name: "foo", Namespace: "default"}}
				reconciliationSourceChannel <- event.GenericEvent{Object: &object}
			}
		}
	}()
  
  // configure the manager with the controller with the apt Watches(...) controller builder
	return ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
    		Watches(&source.Channel{Source: reconciliationSourceChannel}, &handler.EnqueueRequestForObject{}).  // trigger r.Reconcile when a value is received at the reconciliationSourceChannel
		Complete(r)
}
```

So, long story short
We send an event on the channelreconciliationSourceChannel at 12:00AM and the Watches(...) receives it and executes the Reconcile() 
method for the MyCustomResource with the name foo and namespace default
