## Generating scaffolding of CRDs for operator 
When it comes to scaffolding CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) and building Kubernetes operators, both Kubebuilder and Operator SDK are popular frameworks.

1. Create a new project: Run the following command to create a new project with a sample API and controller:

```shell
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/example/
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/example/
$ kubebuilder init --domain example.com --repo=github.com/example/my-operator
$ kubebuilder create api --group=mygroup --version=v1alpha1 --kind=MyKind
```

2. This will generate the basic scaffolding for your operator, including a sample API and controller.

Define your custom resource: Open the ***api/v1alpha1/mykind_types.go*** file and modify the MyKindSpec and MyKindStatus structs to define the desired fields and status of your custom resource.
Generate the CRD: Run the following command to generate the CRD for your custom resource:

```shell
$ make manifests
```
This will generate the ***config/crd/bases/mygroup.example.com_mykinds.yaml*** file, which contains the CRD for your custom resource.

3. Now write your controller logic: Open the controllers/mykind_controller.go file and write the logic for your controller. This will typically involve watching for changes to your custom resource, reconciling the desired state with the actual state, and updating the status of your resource as necessary.

4. Build and deploy your operator: Run the following commands to build and deploy your operator:

```shell
$ make docker-build docker-push IMG=example/my-operator:latest
$ make deploy IMG=example/my-operator:latest
```
This will build a Docker image for your operator, push it to a registry, and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

Both Kubebuilder and Operator SDK are powerful tools for building Kubernetes operators, with Operator SDK providing more features and integrations on top of Kubebuilder's foundations.

- Use Kubebuilder if: You prefer a lightweight framework specifically for Go operators and want direct integration with Kubernetes SIG projects.
- Use Operator SDK if: You need additional features, support for Ansible or Helm operators, and tools for testing, monitoring, and lifecycle management.

Both frameworks follow similar workflows for scaffolding CRDs and controllers, so the choice often comes down to specific project requirements and preferences.

## ConfigmapSync Operator
***This operator is designed to seamlessly synchronize config maps from one namespace to others within a cluster. The usecase is there are so many environments
like dev/QAT. There are configmaps for each provider which will be created in the dev environment needs to be synchronized with QAT environment***

### Step1: Generate a new Kubebuilder project for your operator:

```bash
kubebuilder init --domain your.domain --repo github.com/your/repo
```

### Step 2: Create a ConfigMapCopy API and Controller
Generate a new API and Controller:

```bash
kubebuilder create api --group core --version v1 --kind ConfigMapCopy
```

### Step 3: Define the API for ConfigMapCopy
Edit api/v1/configmapcopy_types.go to define the API structure:

```go
package v1

import (
    metav1 "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1"
)
// ConfigMapSyncSpec defines the desired state of ConfigMapSync
type ConfigMapSyncSpec struct {
    SourceNamespace      string `json:"sourceNamespace"`
    DestinationNamespace string `json:"destinationNamespace"`
    ConfigMapName        string `json:"configMapName"`
}
// ConfigMapSyncStatus defines the observed state of ConfigMapSync
type ConfigMapSyncStatus struct {
    LastSyncTime metav1.Time `json:"lastSyncTime"`
}
// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
// +kubebuilder:subresource:status
// ConfigMapSync is the Schema for the configmapsyncs API
type ConfigMapSync struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
    Spec   ConfigMapSyncSpec   `json:"spec,omitempty"`
    Status ConfigMapSyncStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}
// +kubebuilder:object:root=true
// ConfigMapSyncList contains a list of ConfigMapSync
type ConfigMapSyncList struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ListMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`
    Items           []ConfigMapSync `json:"items"`
}
func init() {
    SchemeBuilder.Register(&ConfigMapSync{}, &ConfigMapSyncList{})
```

## What is ConfigMapCopySpec, ConfigMapCopyStatus signifies, how they are related to CRD, CR or to the actual configmap object? 
### ConfigMapCopySpec

Significance: ConfigMapCopySpec defines the desired state of the ConfigMapCopy resource. This includes any configuration details needed for the operator to perform its task. In this case, it includes the source namespace and target namespace for copying ConfigMaps.

Relation to CRD and CR: The ConfigMapCopySpec is part of the ConfigMapCopy CR defined by the CRD. When you create a ConfigMapCopy CR, you fill out the spec field with the desired configuration.

Example:

```go
type ConfigMapCopySpec struct {
    SourceNamespace string `json:"sourceNamespace"`
    TargetNamespace string `json:"targetNamespace"`
}
```

YAML Representation:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.your.domain/v1
kind: ConfigMapCopy
metadata:
  name: example-configmapcopy
spec:
  sourceNamespace: "source-namespace"
  targetNamespace: "target-namespace"
```

### ConfigMapCopyStatus

- Purpose: This struct defines the status of the ConfigMapSync resource, indicating the observed or current state.
- Fields:
      * LastSyncTime: A timestamp that records when the last sync operation occurred.

### ConfigMapSync
This is the primary definition of the ConfigMapSync Custom Resource. It holds both the desired state (in Spec) and the observed state (in Status).

#### Fields:
- metav1.TypeMeta: Kubernetes metadata for the API version and kind.
- metav1.ObjectMeta: Standard metadata like the name, namespace, and labels for the resource.
- Spec: Holds the desired state, which is defined in ConfigMapSyncSpec.
- Status: Holds the observed state, which is defined in ConfigMapSyncStatus.

## Summary
- CRD: Defines the schema and validation for a new custom resource type.
- CR: An instance of the custom resource, specifying the desired state.
- Operator: A controller that watches for changes in the custom resources and performs actions to manage the resources according to the desired state specified in 
  the CRs.

## Analyse cmd/main.go and internal/*controller.go file and find the relationship between manager, client and schema.

Here’s how they are related:

### 1. Manager (ctrl.Manager)
The manager is a key component in the controller-runtime library. It provides shared dependencies (like the Kubernetes client, scheme, etc.) and coordinates multiple controllers. It simplifies the process of building and running controllers by:

Managing the lifecycle of controllers (starting and stopping them).
Providing shared clients and caches for interacting with the Kubernetes API.
Offering utility functions like setting up signal handlers for graceful shutdowns.
Purpose:

Centralizes and manages all controllers.
Provides shared resources like the client, scheme, and cache.

### 2. ConfigMapSyncReconciler
The ConfigMapSyncReconciler is your controller that implements the business logic to reconcile Kubernetes resources—in this case, ConfigMapSync objects. It needs access to a client (to communicate with the Kubernetes API) and a scheme (to convert between Go structs and Kubernetes API objects).

How it works:

The ConfigMapSyncReconciler is set up with the manager through its SetupWithManager method.
This reconciler defines the Reconcile method, which contains the logic to manage the lifecycle of resources like ConfigMapSync and their dependencies (such as ConfigMap).
The ConfigMapSyncReconciler needs the following:

Client: To communicate with the Kubernetes API.
Scheme: To understand how to serialize and deserialize resources (e.g., from the Kubernetes API to your Go objects).

```go
type ConfigMapSyncReconciler struct {
    Client client.Client
    Scheme *runtime.Scheme
}
```

### 3. Client (client.Client)
The client.Client is used by the ConfigMapSyncReconciler to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Kubernetes objects, such as ConfigMaps, Pods, Deployments, etc. The manager provides this client, which allows the reconciler to:

Fetch resources from the Kubernetes API.
Create or update resources based on the desired state.
Watch resources and respond to changes.
The Client handles all communication between your controller and the Kubernetes API.

How the client is provided:

When you create the manager, it initializes a client and injects it into the reconciler when you call mgr.GetClient().
Example:

```go
// Client injected into ConfigMapSyncReconciler by the manager
reconciler := &ConfigMapSyncReconciler{
    Client: mgr.GetClient(),
    Scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),
}
```

### 4. Scheme (*runtime.Scheme)
The Scheme is used to map Go types (structs) to Kubernetes API resources (such as ConfigMap, Pod, ReplicaSet, etc.). It provides the mechanism for encoding and decoding Kubernetes objects to/from JSON or YAML, allowing the controller to interact with API objects in a type-safe way.

Purpose of Scheme:

Used to register custom resource types.
Allows the controller to convert between the Kubernetes API’s JSON representations and the Go types your controller uses.
Like the Client, the Scheme is provided by the manager through mgr.GetScheme(). This is especially important if your controller is managing Custom Resources, as they need to be registered in the scheme.

```go
// Scheme injected into ConfigMapSyncReconciler by the manager
reconciler := &ConfigMapSyncReconciler{
    Client: mgr.GetClient(),
    Scheme: mgr.GetScheme(),
}
```

### How They Work Together:
- Manager: Central component that initializes and manages shared resources like the Client, Scheme, and controller lifecycle.
- ConfigMapSyncReconciler: A controller that uses the Client and Scheme to manage ConfigMapSync objects.
- Client: The API interface for your reconciler to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster.
- Scheme: The mechanism for translating between API objects and Go types, necessary for understanding the resources your controller manages.
