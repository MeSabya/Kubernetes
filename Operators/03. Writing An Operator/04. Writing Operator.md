## Generating scaffolding of CRDs for operator 
When it comes to scaffolding CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) and building Kubernetes operators, both Kubebuilder and Operator SDK are popular frameworks.

1. Create a new project: Run the following command to create a new project with a sample API and controller:

```shell
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/example/
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/example/
$ kubebuilder init --domain example.com --repo=github.com/example/my-operator
$ kubebuilder create api --group=mygroup --version=v1alpha1 --kind=MyKind
```

2. This will generate the basic scaffolding for your operator, including a sample API and controller.

Define your custom resource: Open the ***api/v1alpha1/mykind_types.go*** file and modify the MyKindSpec and MyKindStatus structs to define the desired fields and status of your custom resource.
Generate the CRD: Run the following command to generate the CRD for your custom resource:

```shell
$ make manifests
```
This will generate the ***config/crd/bases/mygroup.example.com_mykinds.yaml*** file, which contains the CRD for your custom resource.

3. Now write your controller logic: Open the controllers/mykind_controller.go file and write the logic for your controller. This will typically involve watching for changes to your custom resource, reconciling the desired state with the actual state, and updating the status of your resource as necessary.

4. Build and deploy your operator: Run the following commands to build and deploy your operator:

```shell
$ make docker-build docker-push IMG=example/my-operator:latest
$ make deploy IMG=example/my-operator:latest
```
This will build a Docker image for your operator, push it to a registry, and deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

Both Kubebuilder and Operator SDK are powerful tools for building Kubernetes operators, with Operator SDK providing more features and integrations on top of Kubebuilder's foundations.

- Use Kubebuilder if: You prefer a lightweight framework specifically for Go operators and want direct integration with Kubernetes SIG projects.
- Use Operator SDK if: You need additional features, support for Ansible or Helm operators, and tools for testing, monitoring, and lifecycle management.

Both frameworks follow similar workflows for scaffolding CRDs and controllers, so the choice often comes down to specific project requirements and preferences.

## Reference to operator project1:
### ConfigmapSync Operator
This operator is designed to seamlessly synchronize config maps from one namespace to others within a cluster.
