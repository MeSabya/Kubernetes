# controller-runtime component â€” Reconciler
The Reconciler is a crucial component within controller-runtime that encapsulates the core reconciliation logic. 
It requires developers to implement the Reconcile function, which serves as the entry point for performing the actual reconciliation process.

## How Reconcilation Process works 

Here's how it works:

ðŸ‘‰ **Watch Mechanism**: The controller sets up watch mechanisms with the Kubernetes API server for the resources it wants to monitor. This is typically done during the controller initialization phase.

ðŸ‘‰ **Event Notification**: When there is a change to a monitored resource (such as creation, update, or deletion), the Kubernetes API server sends an event notification to the controller. These events are typically transmitted over HTTP long-polling connections.

ðŸ‘‰ **Queueing Events**: Upon receiving an event notification, the controller adds the event to an internal queue. The event contains information about the change that occurred, such as the type of operation (create, update, delete) and the affected resource.

ðŸ‘‰ **Reconciliation**: The controller's main loop continuously dequeues events from the queue and processes them by calling the Reconcile function. The Reconcile function is responsible for reconciling the desired state of the resource with the actual state in the cluster.

ðŸ‘‰ **Requeuing (Optional)**: If necessary, the Reconcile function can requeue the item back into the queue to allow for additional reconciliation attempts. This is useful in scenarios where reconciliation fails temporarily due to external factors (e.g., network issues, resource unavailability), and the controller needs to retry the reconciliation later.

In summary, the Kubernetes API server is responsible for sending events to the controller whenever changes occur to monitored resources. 
The controller then processes these events, typically by calling the Reconcile function, to ensure that the desired state of the resources is
maintained in the Kubernetes cluster.

## How to implement Reconciler
There are two ways to implement a Reconciler:

1. With your own struct (e.g. reconciler) with Reconcile function
2. With reconcile.Func

### With your own struct with Reconcile function
To implement a Reconciler using your own struct and the Reconcile function, follow these steps:

Define your struct that will serve as the reconciler. This struct can have additional fields or dependencies as needed.
In the Reconcile function, you can access the necessary context and the request object that contains the name and namespace of the object being reconciled. 
Use this information to perform your reconciliation logic.

```golang
type ReconcilerStruct struct {
  // Add your fields or dependencies here
}

func (r *ReconcilerStruct) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req reconcile.Request) (reconcile.Result, error) {
  // Implement your reconciliation logic here
  // You can read and write objects, perform desired actions, and return the result
  return reconcile.Result{}, nil
}
```

### With reconcile.Func
Another way to implement a Reconciler is by using the reconile.Func provided by the reconcile package. 
This approach simplifies the implementation process. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

```golang
reconcile.Func(func(ctx context.Context, req reconcile.Request) (reconcile.Result, error) {
  // Implement your reconciliation logic here
  // You can read and write objects, perform desired actions, and return the result

  return reconcile.Result{}, nil
})
```
