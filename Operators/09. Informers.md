Reference: https://utsabsapkota.hashnode.dev/informers-vs-watches-kubernetes

An informer is a core mechanism in Kubernetes controllers (under the hood) that:

- Watches resources (like Pods, CRDs, ConfigMaps, etc.)
- Caches them in memory
- Delivers events (Add, Update, Delete) to your controller when something changes
- Think of it as a smart, event-driven, local cache that saves API calls and keeps your controller fast and responsive.

### Why informer is important?

👉 Without informers:

- You’d constantly poll the API server to check for changes (expensive and slow).
- Your controller wouldn’t be reactive to changes like resource creation or deletion.

👉 With informers:

- You get notified immediately when a resource you're watching is created, updated, or deleted.
- You get access to the local cached copy instead of hitting the API every time.

### Internally it uses:

- Reflector → talks to API server
- DeltaFIFO → queues changes
- Store → in-memory cache

### As a developer using Kubebuilder / controller-runtime, do you need to write informers yourself?
Nope! 🎉
You don’t write informers directly when using controller-runtime (like you do in client-go).

✅ controller-runtime already wraps and uses informers internally.

For example:

```go

ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
    For(&myv1.MyCustomResource{}).
    Complete(r)
```

This sets up informers for MyCustomResource automatically behind the scenes.
When a resource is created, updated, or deleted — your Reconcile function is called.
