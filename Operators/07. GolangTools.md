## Some important golang tools

### 1. go mod graph | grep "k8s.io/client-go"
is used to inspect dependencies in a Go module's dependency graph, specifically filtering to see all modules that depend on or reference k8s.io/apimachinery.

Here's a breakdown:

- go mod graph: This command displays the dependency graph of the Go module in the current directory. It shows each module and the dependencies it directly and indirectly relies on, listed as pairs in the format <module1>@<version1> <module2>@<version2>.

- | grep "k8s.io/apimachinery": This part pipes the output of go mod graph to grep, which filters and only shows lines that contain k8s.io/apimachinery. This means you're looking specifically for entries in the dependency graph related to the k8s.io/apimachinery module, often used in Kubernetes projects for shared utilities and APIs.

### 2. go mod tidy 
The go mod tidy command in Go is used to clean up the go.mod file by adding any missing module requirements 
and removing any dependencies that are no longer used in the project.

### 3. go list -m -versions sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime
list the available versions

### 4. go clean -modcache
The go clean -modcache command is used in Go to clear the local module cache. This cache is where Go stores downloaded dependencies (modules), 
and it can sometimes accumulate unused or outdated modules. 
Running go clean -modcache removes all cached module versions, forcing Go to re-download them when they are next needed.
