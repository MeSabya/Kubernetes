## kubebuilder vs operator SDK
### Foundations:

Kubebuilder is the core framework, close to Kubernetes native conventions.
Operator SDK builds on Kubebuilder, adding more tools and supporting multiple operator types (Go, Helm, Ansible).

### Operator Types:

Kubebuilder: Go-based operators only.
Operator SDK: Go, Helm, and Ansible operators.

### Tooling:

Kubebuilder: Provides essential scaffolding and testing tools.
Operator SDK: Extends Kubebuilder with additional tools for testing, monitoring, and OLM integration.

### Use Cases:

Kubebuilder: Ideal if you want a Kubernetes-native, Go-only framework.
Operator SDK: Better if you need multi-language support, enhanced tooling, or plan to deploy on OpenShift.

### Learning Curve:

Both are similar for Go-based operators, with Operator SDK offering easier options for Helm and Ansible users.
