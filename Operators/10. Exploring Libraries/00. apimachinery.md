## Using metav1.ObjectMeta to Add Metadata to a Custom Struct

<details>

### What is TypeMeta and ObjectMeta in apimachinery?

#### 1. ObjectMeta
ObjectMeta is a struct defined by apimachinery
It contains the basic metadata fields every K8s resource must have.

âœ… These fields include:

Field	Meaning

- Name	Name of the object (spec.name)
- Namespace	Namespace it belongs to
- Labels	Key-value tags
- Annotations	Key-value notes
- UID	Unique ID (auto-generated)
- CreationTimestamp	When the object was created
- Finalizers	List of finalizers
- OwnerReferences	To handle cascading deletion
- ResourceVersion	To help Kubernetes manage concurrency

#### 2. TypeMeta
TypeMeta is much smaller.
It carries just two fields:


##### Field	Meaning

- Kind	What type of object (Pod, Deployment, your CRD, etc.)
- APIVersion	Which API group/version (like apps/v1, mygroup/v1alpha1)

This is important because when Kubernetes communicates (API server <-> controller <-> clients), it needs to know:

- Kind: What type of object is this? (Pod, Service, MyResource etc.)
- APIVersion: Which version of the schema are you following?

Now see a simple example:
Imagine you define a custom resource like:

```aml
apiVersion: mygroup.io/v1alpha1
kind: MyResource
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: default
spec:
  size: 3
```
When you parse this YAML into Go structs inside your controller:

- apiVersion â†’ Comes from TypeMeta.APIVersion
- kind â†’ Comes from TypeMeta.Kind
- metadata.name, metadata.namespace â†’ Comes from ObjectMeta.Name, ObjectMeta.Namespace
- spec.size â†’ Comes from your custom Spec struct

â†’ Without embedding TypeMeta and ObjectMeta, your CRD couldn't properly decode the YAML at all!

##### Your CRD Go Struct
When you generate your Go structs for the CRD, you always write:

```go
type MyResource struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`    // <--- embedding
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

    Spec   MyResourceSpec   `json:"spec,omitempty"`
    Status MyResourceStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}
```
TypeMeta and ObjectMeta are embedded â€” meaning, their fields are inserted directly into your MyResource.
No need to manually redefine Name, Namespace, Kind, APIVersion, etc.!

## Finalizers Management

## Using runtime.Object and DeepCopyObject()

<details>

## why need DeepCopyObject?
  
In Kubernetes, when you watch resources (like Pods, CRs, Deployments):

The informers (client-go) receive events: ADD, UPDATE, DELETE

Same Go object (pointer) may be shared across many goroutines

If you modify the object directly, you affect other consumers unintentionally ðŸ’¥

Thus:
- âœ… Controllers must clone the object first, safely.
- âœ… DeepCopyObject() is how Kubernetes knows how to deep-copy any resource!

### Real Practical Example
Imagine your Reconcile loop:

```go
var mycr myv1.MyCustomResource
_ = client.Get(ctx, key, &mycr)

// You want to modify something
mycr.Spec.Replicas = 5

// Now update
_ = client.Update(ctx, &mycr)
```

This looks simple... but without DeepCopyObject, if:

- Another goroutine was reading mycr
- You changed .Spec.Replicas

You would introduce a data race ðŸ”¥

Because multiple go routines are accessing the same memory!

### âœ… So the correct safer way internally is:

```go
copy := mycr.DeepCopy()
copy.Spec.Replicas = 5
_ = client.Update(ctx, copy)
```
You operate on your own copy.

- No concurrency bugs
- No "surprising" mutation for other consumers.

## Label/Field Selectors when Watching Resources
When your controller wants to watch only resources with specific labels, you can use:

## runtime scheme 

<details>

### Real Realtime Usage:
When Kubernetes receives an object (POST or GET),
it must:

- Parse apiVersion: apps/v1 and kind: Deployment
- Look up in the Scheme
- Find the Go struct type corresponding (*appsv1.Deployment)
- Instantiate and decode it

âœ… Without a runtime.Scheme, Kubernetes cannot understand which struct matches which apiVersion/kind!

Example controller:
```go
import (
    appsv1 "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"
    "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime"
)

var Scheme = runtime.NewScheme()

func init() {
    _ = appsv1.AddToScheme(Scheme)
}
```

### Tiny visual flow:
```yaml
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
     |
     v
apiserver reads apiVersion/kind
     |
     v
runtime.Scheme finds Go type
     |
     v
Decode JSON into *appsv1.Deployment
```
#### That's why your controller or webhook server must register its objects to the runtime.Scheme!
This code here: https://github.com/leovct/kube-operator-tutorial/blob/main/operator-v1/internal/controller/foo_controller.go 
How and where our CRD is registered?
https://github.com/leovct/kube-operator-tutorial/blob/main/operator-v1/api/v1/groupversion_info.go#L35

#### Kubebuilder generates api/v1/groupversion_info.go file when you do kubebuilder init and kubebuilder create api.
âœ… That file registers your CRD types into the Scheme.

- âž” It is automatically wired during setup!
- âž” You just don't see it here because itâ€™s happening elsewhere behind the scenes.

## Relation between versioned APIs and apimachinery

<details>

### 1. GroupVersionKind (GVK)
Every object needs to tell what version it belongs to.
apimachinery provides GroupVersionKind struct to capture this.

```go
type GroupVersionKind struct {
    Group   string
    Version string
    Kind    string
}
```

Example:

```go
Group: "apps", Version: "v1", Kind: "Deployment"
```

ðŸ‘‰ apimachinery makes sure that GVK is attached to every object when it is serialized (encoded) and parsed (decoded).

### 2. Scheme
The Scheme in apimachinery/runtime is a registry of known versions and types.

It maps between Go structs and their GVKs.

You must register your versions and types to the Scheme.

Example:

```go
scheme := runtime.NewScheme()
corev1.AddToScheme(scheme)
apps.AddToScheme(scheme)
```
- ðŸ‘‰ Without a Scheme, Kubernetes wouldn't know how to decode a Pod when it sees apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod.
- ðŸ‘‰ When you create custom resources (CRDs), you also need to add their versions to a Scheme.

### 3. Serialization / Deserialization
When Kubernetes API server receives a request:

It uses apimachinery serializers (like JSON or protobuf serializers) to decode request body into a typed object.

Again, this needs the Scheme.

### 4. Conversion Between Versions
When an object exists in multiple versions (e.g., v1beta1 and v1), apimachinery enables conversion:

ConvertTo and ConvertFrom interfaces.

Conversion Webhooks also plug into apimachinery logic.

Example:

```go
func (src *DeploymentV1beta1) ConvertTo(dstRaw conversion.Hub) error { ... }
```

apimachinery automatically calls your conversion methods when necessary.
