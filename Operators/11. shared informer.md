When monitoring Kubernetes resources such as pods or deployments, the traditional approach 
often involves frequently polling data from the Kubernetes API server. This is typically achieved through 
repetitive API calls, set to occur at regular intervals.

This approach, however, may not be the most efficient. Picture a scenario where no updates 
have been made to the Kubernetes resources between these polling intervals. 
In essence, nothing has changed since the last data retrieval,
and the subsequent API call only retrieves redundant information.

This is where the Shared Informer Factory comes in. Using a Shared Informer Factory is 
a more performance-friendly alternative. 
Instead of constantly polling the API server, it provides event-driven notifications.

## What’s actually happening under the hood

When you do something like:

```go
ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr).
    For(&corev1.Pod{}).
    Complete(r)
```

Controller-runtime internally does:

- Registers an informer for Pods.
- Adds an event handler that enqueues reconcile requests.
- Starts the informer when you call mgr.Start().
- On every Add/Update/Delete, enqueues a reconcile request → your Reconcile() method runs.
