# Operator vs Admission controller in k8s 
## Operator:

### Purpose: 
Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application. They encode the operational knowledge of running a specific application, automating tasks like deploying, scaling, and updating.

### Key Features:

- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs): Operators typically use Custom Resource Definitions to define custom resources that represent the application and its components.
- Controllers: Operators include custom controllers that watch for changes to the custom resources and take appropriate actions to ensure the desired state is maintained.
- Lifecycle Management: Operators manage the entire lifecycle of an application, including provisioning, scaling, and updating.

### Example Use Case:

An etcd operator managing an etcd cluster: The operator watches for changes to custom resources representing etcd clusters, and it automatically scales, upgrades, or recovers the etcd cluster based on the desired state.
Benefits:

Automates complex application operations.
Enables the management of stateful applications with complex lifecycles.

## Admission Controller:

### Purpose: Admission controllers are a set of plug-ins that intercept and modify the admission process of creating, updating, or deleting resources in a Kubernetes cluster. They enforce policies, validate and mutate resource configurations before they are persisted.

### Key Features:

- Webhooks: Admission controllers are implemented as webhooks that are called during the admission process.
- Policies: They enforce policies such as security, resource constraints, and custom validations.
- Mutating and Validating Webhooks: Admission controllers can be validating (reject or admit requests based on policy) or mutating (modify requests before they are persisted).

### Example Use Case:

Limiting the resources (CPU, memory) that can be requested in a Pod: An admission controller can validate Pod specifications and reject them if they exceed specified resource limits.

### Benefits:

- Enforces policies and constraints.
- Provides an additional layer of security and governance.

## Summary:
In summary, operators are focused on managing the lifecycle of applications, especially stateful applications with complex operational requirements. 
On the other hand, admission controllers are focused on enforcing policies and constraints during the resource admission process, 
ensuring that resources meet certain criteria before they are accepted into the cluster.

Both operators and admission controllers contribute to the extensibility and customizability of Kubernetes, enabling users to tailor the platform to their specific requirements.
