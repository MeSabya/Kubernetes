## Defination
Kubernetes' operator pattern concept lets you extend the cluster's behaviour without modifying the code of Kubernetes itself by linking 
controllers to one or more custom resources. Operators are clients of the Kubernetes API that act as controllers for a Custom Resource.

## Usecases
Some of the things that you can use an operator to automate include:

- deploying an application on demand
- taking and restoring backups of that application's state
- handling upgrades of the application code alongside related changes such as database schemas or extra configuration settings
- publishing a Service to applications that don't support Kubernetes APIs to discover them
- simulating failure in all or part of your cluster to test its resilience
- choosing a leader for a distributed application without an internal member election process

## Other Usecases
While operators are often associated with managing stateful applications, their utility extends beyond just stateful workloads. 
Operators, as a design pattern, are employed to automate the operation and management of complex applications on Kubernetes. Here are some scenarios where operators can be beneficial:

### Stateful Applications:
Database Systems: Operators are commonly used to manage databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. They can handle tasks such as backup, restore, scaling, and upgrades.

### Middleware and Services:
- Message Brokers: Operators can be created for managing message brokers like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ, automating tasks related to scaling, configuration, and topic management.
- Caching Systems: Operators can automate the deployment and management of caching systems like Redis or Memcached.

### Custom Applications:
Application-Specific Logic: If your application has specific operational requirements that go beyond what generic controllers provide, an operator can be tailored to handle those needs.

### Application Deployment and Configuration:
- Deployment Automation: Operators can automate complex deployment scenarios, ensuring that applications are deployed, configured, and scaled according to specific requirements.
- Configuration Management: Operators can manage the configuration of applications, adjusting settings based on changes in the environment.

### Compliance and Governance:
Policy Enforcement: Operators can enforce policies and governance rules for applications, ensuring compliance with security, regulatory, or organizational standards.

### Multi-Tenant Environments:
- Isolation and Tenancy: Operators can help manage the isolation and tenancy of applications in multi-tenant environments, ensuring that resources are allocated appropriately.

### Monitoring and Metrics:
Monitoring Integration: Operators can integrate with monitoring systems, automatically configuring metrics, alerts, and other monitoring-related aspects of applications.

### Application Upgrades:
Rolling Upgrades: Operators can handle rolling upgrades of applications, ensuring minimal downtime and automated rollback in case of failures.

In summary, while operators are commonly associated with stateful applications due to their ability to handle complex state management tasks, 
they can be employed in various scenarios to automate and manage the entire lifecycle of applications on Kubernetes. 
The key is to design the operator to encapsulate the operational knowledge specific to the application it manages, making it easier to deploy, scale, and maintain complex systems.

# Learn about controller before understanding operator

## What is a Controller?
In simple terms, a controller is a endless loop that continuously checks the state of every object inside a system . 
Whenever the state of an object changes, a dedicated handler is invoked that is responsible for performing an action.

When you create an object in Kubernetes you define the state of the object which is then persisted to the data store. 
Kubernetes runs many controllers in the background to continuously track the state of these objects. If the controller detects any change to that object, Kubernetes tries to bring it back to the desired state.

## Components of a controller

### Informer/SharedInformer:
Informers are a part of the client-go library in Kubernetes, which is a Go client library for the Kubernetes API. 
An Informer is responsible for watching and listing resources from the Kubernetes API server and maintaining an up-to-date local cache of those resources. 
It helps controllers to react to changes in resources without directly querying the API server each time.

The SharedInformer is an abstraction built on top of the Informer. It allows multiple controllers to share a single cache of resources, 
reducing redundant API calls and improving efficiency. SharedInformers are commonly used in Kubernetes controllers to keep track of the state of resources they manage.

### Workqueue:
A work queue is a mechanism used by controllers to manage and process tasks asynchronously. In the context of controllers, 
tasks often involve handling events triggered by changes in resources. The work queue allows controllers to enqueue tasks in response to events and then process those tasks in a controlled manner.
Work queues are beneficial for handling tasks that might be rate-limited or need to be retried. 
They provide a way to decouple the receiving of events (e.g., from informers) and the processing of those events. 
This separation allows for better control over the concurrency and ensures that tasks are processed in a controlled manner.
