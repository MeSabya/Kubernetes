# The ConfigMap
ConfigMap allows us to “inject” configuration into containers. The source of the configs can be files, directories, or literal values. The destination can be files or environment variables.

ConfigMap takes a configuration from a source and mounts it into running containers as a volume.

That’s all the theory you’ll get up-front. Instead of a lengthy explanation, we’ll run some examples, and comment on the features we experience. We’ll be learning by doing, instead of learning by memorizing theory.

# Injecting Configuration from a Single File 

***prometheus-conf.yml***

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: prometheus
    metrics_path: /prometheus/metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - localhost:9090
```


```yaml
kubectl create cm my-config --from-file=prometheus-conf.yml
```

☝️ We created a ConfigMap (cm) called my-config. The data of the map is the content of the prometheus-conf.yml file.

## Mounting the ConfigMap#
ConfigMap is useless by itself. It is yet another Volume that, like all the others, needs a mount.

### Pod with Mounted ConfigMap#
Let’s take a look at a Pod specification defined in 

***alpine.yml***

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: alpine
spec:
  containers:
  - name: alpine
    image: alpine
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["100000"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-vol
      mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
  - name: config-vol
    configMap:
      name: my-config
```
The essential sections are volumeMounts and volumes. Since volumeMounts are the same no matter the type of the Volume, there’s nothing special about it. We defined that it should be based on the volume called config-vol and that it should mount the path /etc/config. The volumes section uses configMap as the type and, in this case, has a single item name, that coincides with the name of the ConfigMap we created earlier.

## Verification#
Let’s see the content of the /etc/config directory inside the Pod’s only container.

```yaml
kubectl exec -it alpine --  ls -l /etc/config
```
# Injecting Configurations from Multiple Files and a directory

```yaml
kubectl create cm my-config \
    --from-file=prometheus-conf.yml \
    --from-file=prometheus.yml

kubectl create -f alpine.yml

#Run the following command separately
kubectl exec -it alpine -- \
    ls /etc/config

kubectl delete -f alpine.yml
#Run the following command separately to delete the configmap
kubectl delete cm my-config

# Run the following command separately to create a configmap using a directory
kubectl create cm my-config \
    --from-file=cm

kubectl describe cm my-config

kubectl create -f alpine.yml
#Run the below command separately after the "alpine" container is created
kubectl exec -it alpine -- \
    ls /etc/config

kubectl delete -f alpine.yml

#Run the following command separately to delete the configmap
kubectl delete cm my-config
```

# Injecting Configurations from Key/Value Literals

## Creating ConfigMap Using Literals#
Hopefully, even when our applications need different configs to work in distinct clusters, the differences are limited. Often, they should be limited to only a few key/value entries. In such cases, it might be easier to create ConfigMaps using --from-literal.

Let’s take a look at an example.

```yaml
kubectl create cm my-config \
    --from-literal=something=else \
    --from-literal=weather=sunny

kubectl get cm my-config -o yaml
```

The output of the latter command is as follows (metadata is removed for brevity).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  something: else
  weather: sunny
kind: ConfigMap
...
```
Then we can mount the configmap as described above using volume and volumemounts.

# Injecting Configurations from Environment Files
Let’s take a look at the my-env-file.yml file.

```yaml
something=else
weather=sunny
```

```yaml
kubectl create cm my-config \
    --from-env-file=my-env-file.yml

kubectl get cm my-config -o yaml
```

# Converting ConfigMap Output into Environment Variables

No matter whether ConfigMap is created from a file, from a directory, from literal values, or from an environment file, it perpetually resulted in one or more files being injected into a container.

This time we’ll try something different. We’ll see how we can convert a ConfigMap into environment variables.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: alpine-env
spec:
  containers:
  - name: alpine
    image: alpine
    command: ["sleep"]
    args: ["100000"]
    env:
    - name: something
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: my-config
          key: something
    - name: weather
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: my-config
          key: weather
```

The major difference, when compared with alpine.yml, is that volumeMounts and volumes sections are gone. This time we have an env section.

Instead of a value field, we have valueFrom. Further on, we declared that it should get values from a ConfigMap (configMapKeyRef) named my-config. Since that ConfigMap has multiple values, we specified the key as well.
