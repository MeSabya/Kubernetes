# Kubernetes multi-container pods and container communication

## Why does Kubernetes use a Pod as the smallest deployable unit, and not a single container?

👉 A container is an existing entity, which refers to a specific thing. That specific thing might be a Docker container, but it might also be a rkt container, or a virtual machine (VM) managed by Virtlet. Each of these has different requirements.

👉 Kubernetes needs additional information for container management, such as a restart policy, which defines what to do with a container when it terminates, or a liveness probe, which defines an action to detect if a process in a container is still alive from the application’s perspective, such as a web server responding to HTTP requests.

>Instead of overloading the existing “thing” with additional properties, Kubernetes architects have decided to use a new entity, the Pod, that logically contains (wraps) one or more containers that should be managed as a single entity.

## Why does Kubernetes allow more than one container in a Pod?

👉 *Containers in a Pod run on a “logical host”; they use the **same network namespace (in other words, the same IP address and port space), and the same IPC namespace**. They can also use shared volumes. These properties make it possible for these containers to efficiently communicate, ensuring data locality. Also, Pods enable you to manage several tightly coupled application containers as a single unit.*

## Use Cases for Multi-Container Pods

The primary purpose of a multi-container Pod is to support co-located, co-managed helper processes for a primary application. There are some general patterns for using helper processes in Pods:

✔ **Sidecar containers** “help” the main container. Some examples include log or data change watchers, monitoring adapters, and so on. A log watcher, for example, can be built once by a different team and reused across different applications. Another example of a sidecar container is a file or data loader that generates data for the main container.

✔ **Proxies, bridges, and adapters** connect the main container with the external world. 
For example, Apache HTTP server or nginx can serve static files. 
It can also act as a reverse proxy to a web application in the main container to log and limit HTTP requests. 
Another example is a helper container that re-routes requests from the main container to the external world. 
This makes it possible for the main container to connect to localhost to access, for example, an external database, but without any service discovery.

## Communication between containers in a Pod

They can do this using several different methods.

### Shared volumes in a Kubernetes Pod

- In Kubernetes, you can use a shared Kubernetes Volume as a simple and efficient way to share data between containers in a Pod. For most cases, it is sufficient to use a directory on the host that is shared with all containers within a Pod.

### Inter-process communications (IPC)

👉 Containers in a Pod share the same IPC namespace, which means they can also communicate with each other using standard inter-process communications such as SystemV semaphores or POSIX shared memory.

### Inter-container network communication

>Containers in a Pod are accessible via “localhost”; they use the **same network namespace. Also, for containers, the observable host name is a Pod’s name. 
>Because containers share the same IP address and port space**, you should use different ports in containers for incoming connections. In other words, applications in a Pod must coordinate their usage of ports.
