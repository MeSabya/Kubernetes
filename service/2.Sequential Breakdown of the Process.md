## The Sequence#
The processes that were initiated with the creation of the Service are as follows:

Kubernetes client (kubectl) sent a request to the API server requesting the creation of the Service based on Pods created through the go-demo-2 ReplicaSet.

Endpoint controller is watching the API server for new service events. It detected that there is a new Service object.

Endpoint controller created endpoint objects with the same name as the Service, and it used Service selector to identify endpoints (in this case the IP and the port of go-demo-2 Pods).

kube-proxy is watching for service and endpoint objects. It detected that there is a new Service and a new endpoint object.

kube-proxy added iptables rules which capture traffic to the Service port and redirect it to endpoints. For each endpoint object, it adds iptables rule which selects a Pod.

The kube-dns add-on is watching for Service. It detected that there is a new service.

The kube-dns added db's record to the dns server (skydns).

The sequence we described is useful when we want to understand everything that happened in the cluster from the moment we requested the creation of a new Service.

Run the following widget to deploy cluster and pods, and expose service from the previous lesson.

Letâ€™s take a look at our new Service.
