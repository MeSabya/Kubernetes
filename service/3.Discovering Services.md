## Discovering services using DNS and environment variables

Services can be discovered through two principal modes:

- Environment variables
- DNS

Every Pod gets environment variables for each of the active Services. They are provided in the same format as what Docker links expect, as well with the simpler Kubernetes-specific syntax.

Let’s take a look at the environment variables available in one of the Pods we’re running i.e. go-demo-2-db.

Let's get environment variables for go-demo-2-db

```python
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pod \
    --no-headers \
    -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name \
    -l type=api,service=go-demo-2 \
    | tail -1)

kubectl exec $POD_NAME -- env
```

The output, limited to the environment variables related to the go-demo-2-db service, is as follows.

```python
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
HOSTNAME=go-demo-2-api-9c582
DB=go-demo-2-db
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.43.0.1
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443
KUBERNETES_PORT=tcp://10.43.0.1:443
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP=tcp://10.43.0.1:443
GO_DEMO_2_DB_SERVICE_PORT=27017
GO_DEMO_2_API_SERVICE_HOST=10.43.230.136
GO_DEMO_2_API_PORT=tcp://10.43.230.136:8080
GO_DEMO_2_API_PORT_8080_TCP_PROTO=tcp
GO_DEMO_2_DB_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR=10.43.216.181
GO_DEMO_2_DB_PORT=tcp://10.43.216.181:27017
GO_DEMO_2_DB_PORT_27017_TCP=tcp://10.43.216.181:27017
GO_DEMO_2_DB_PORT_27017_TCP_PROTO=tcp
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PORT=443
GO_DEMO_2_API_SERVICE_PORT=8080
GO_DEMO_2_API_PORT_8080_TCP=tcp://10.43.230.136:8080
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_PROTO=tcp
KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR=10.43.0.1
GO_DEMO_2_DB_SERVICE_HOST=10.43.216.181
GO_DEMO_2_DB_PORT_27017_TCP_PORT=27017
GO_DEMO_2_API_PORT_8080_TCP_PORT=8080
GO_DEMO_2_API_PORT_8080_TCP_ADDR=10.43.230.136
KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443
HOME=/root
```

when we describe the go-demo-2-db Service , we will get also same type of output:

```python
Name:              go-demo-2-db
Namespace:         default
Labels:            <none>
Annotations:       <none>
Selector:          service=go-demo-2,type=db
Type:              ClusterIP
IP Family Policy:  SingleStack
IP Families:       IPv4
IP:                10.43.216.181
IPs:               10.43.216.181
Port:              <unset>  27017/TCP
TargetPort:        27017/TCP
Endpoints:         10.42.0.5:27017
Session Affinity:  None
Events:            <none>
```

### Sequential breakdown of the process
Let’s go through the sequence of events related to service discovery and components involved.

When the api container go-demo-2 tries to connect with the go-demo-2-db Service, it looks at the nameserver configured in /etc/resolv.conf. kubelet configured the nameserver with the kube-dns Service IP (10.96.0.10) during the Pod scheduling process.

The container queries the DNS server listening to port 53. go-demo-2-db DNS gets resolved to the service IP 10.0.0.19. This DNS record was added by kube-dns during the service creation process.

The container uses the service IP which forwards requests through the iptables rules. They were added by kube-proxy during Service and Endpoint creation process.

Since we only have one replica of the go-demo-2-db Pod, iptables forwards requests to just one endpoint. If we had multiple replicas, iptables would act as a load balancer and forward requests randomly among Endpoints of the Service.
