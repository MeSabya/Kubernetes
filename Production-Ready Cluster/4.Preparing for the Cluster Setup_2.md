In this lesson, we‚Äôll create a few Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. Even though we could create a cluster with the user you used to register to AWS, it is a good practice to create a separate account that contains only the privileges we‚Äôll need for the exercises that follow.

Creating the IAM Group#
First, we‚Äôll create an IAM group called kops.

We don‚Äôt care much for any of the information from the output except that it does not contain an error message thus confirming that the group was created successfully.

Next, we‚Äôll assign a few policies to the group thus providing the future users of the group with sufficient permissions to create the objects we‚Äôll need.

Since our cluster will consist of EC2 instances, the group will need to have the permissions to create and manage them. We‚Äôll need a place to store the state of the cluster so we‚Äôll need access to S3. Furthermore, we need to add VPCs to the mix so that our cluster is isolated from prying eyes. Finally, we‚Äôll need to be able to create additional IAMs.

In AWS, user permissions are granted by creating policies. We‚Äôll need AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonS3FullAccess, AmazonVPCFullAccess, and IAMFullAccess.

The commands that attach the required policies to the kops group are as follows.

```shell
aws iam attach-group-policy \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess \
    --group-name kops

aws iam attach-group-policy \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess \
    --group-name kops

aws iam attach-group-policy \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonVPCFullAccess \
    --group-name kops

aws iam attach-group-policy \
    --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess \
    --group-name kops
 ```
 
 ## Creating a User#
Now that we have a group with the sufficient permissions, we should create a user as well.

Just as when we created the group, the contents of the output are not important, except as a confirmation that the command was executed successfully.

The user we created does not yet belong to the kops group. We‚Äôll fix that next.

Installing jq to Parse the Credentials#
We need the SecretAccessKey and AccessKeyId entries. So, the next step is to parse the content of the kops-creds file and store those two values as the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

In the spirit of full automation, we‚Äôll use jq to parse the contents of the kops-creds file. Please download and install the distribution suited for your OS.

üìù ***A note to Windows users#***
Using Chocolatey, install jq from an Administrator Command Prompt via choco install jq.

```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(\
    cat kops-creds | jq -r \
    '.AccessKey.AccessKeyId')

export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(
    cat kops-creds | jq -r \
    '.AccessKey.SecretAccessKey')
```
We used cat to output contents of the file and combined it with jq to filter the input so that only the field we need is retrieved.

From now on, all the AWS CLI commands will not be executed by the administrative user you used to register to AWS, but as kops.

It is imperative that the kops-creds file is secured and not accessible to anyone but people you trust. The best method to secure it varies from one organization to another. No matter what you do, do not write it on a post-it and stick it to your monitor. Storing it in one of your GitHub repositories is even worse.

In the next lesson, we will continue to prepare for the setup of our production-ready cluster by setting up the availability zones and SSH keys.
