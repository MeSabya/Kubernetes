## Setting Up the Availability Zones#
In this lesson, we will decide which availability zones should we use. So, let‚Äôs take a look at what‚Äôs available in the us-east-2 region.

As we can see, the region has three availability zones. We‚Äôll store them in an environment variable.

üìù A note to Windows users#
>Please use tr '\r\n' ', ' instead of tr '\n' ',' in the command that follows.

```shell
export ZONES=$(aws ec2 \
    describe-availability-zones \
    --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION \
    | jq -r \
    '.AvailabilityZones[].ZoneName' \
    | tr '\n' ',' | tr -d ' ')

ZONES=${ZONES%?}

echo $ZONES
```

Just as with the access keys, we used jq to limit the results only to the zone names, and we combined that with tr that replaced new lines with commas. The second command removes the trailing comma.

The output of the last command that echoed the values of the environment variable is as follows.

We‚Äôll discuss the reasons behind the usage of three availability zones later on. For now, just remember that they are stored in the environment variable ZONES.

üîê Creating SSH Keys#
The last preparation step is to create SSH keys required for the setup. Since we might create some other artifacts during the process, we‚Äôll create a directory dedicated to the creation of the cluster.

All those steps might look a bit daunting if this is your first contact with AWS. Nevertheless, they are pretty standard. No matter what you do in AWS, you‚Äôd need to perform, more or less, the same actions. Not all of them are mandatory, but they are good practices. Having a dedicated (non-admin) user and a group with only required policies is always a good idea. Access keys are necessary for any aws command. Without SSH keys, no one can interactively log in to a server.

The good news is that we‚Äôre finished with the prerequisites. In the next lesson, we can turn our attention towards creating a Kubernetes cluster.
