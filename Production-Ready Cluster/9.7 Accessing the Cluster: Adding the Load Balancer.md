## kops Add-Ons

kops has a solution for the addition of a load balancer. We can use kops’ add-ons to deploy additional core services. You can get the list of those currently available by exploring directories here. Even though most of them are useful, we’ll focus only on the task at hand.

Add-ons are, in most cases, Kubernetes resources defined in a YAML file. All we have to do is pick the addon we want, choose the version we prefer, and execute kubectl create.

We’ll create the resources defined in ingress-nginx version v1.6.0.

## Creating Resources

We won’t go into details behind the definition YAML file we are about to use to create the resources kops assembled for us. Instead, we’ll proceed with kubectl create.

```shell
kubectl create \
    -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kops/master/addons/ingress-nginx/v1.6.0.yaml
```

We can see that it created two deployments, which created two ReplicaSets, which created Pods. In addition, we got two Services as well. As a result, Ingress is running inside our cluster and are a step closer to being able to test it. Still, we need to figure out how to access the cluster.

The above output may have some formatting differences due to continuous version upgrades.

The Load Balancer
One of the two Services (ingress-nginx) is LoadBalancer. We did not explore that type when we discussed Services.

LoadBalancer Service type exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer. NodePort and ClusterIP services, to which the external load balancer will route, are automatically created. Ingress is “intelligent” enough to know how to create and configure an AWS ELB. All it needed is an annotation service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-proxy-protocol (defined in the YAML file).

You’ll notice that the ingress-nginx Service published port 31895 and mapped it to 80. 32697 was mapped to 443. That means that, from inside the cluster, we should be able to send HTTP requests to 31895 and HTTPS to 32697. However, that is only part of the story. Since the Service is the LoadBalancer type, we should expect some changes to AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) as well.

Verification
Let’s check the state of the load balancers in our cluster.

```shell
aws elb describe-load-balancers
```

```shell 
{
  "LoadBalancerDescriptions": [
    {
      ...
      "LoadBalancerName": "api-devops23-k8s-local-ivnbim",
      ...
    }, 
    {
      ...
      "ListenerDescriptions": [
        {
          "Listener": {
            "InstancePort": 31895, 
            "LoadBalancerPort": 80, 
            "Protocol": "TCP", 
            "InstanceProtocol": "TCP"
          }, 
          "PolicyNames": []
        }, 
        {
          "Listener": {
            "InstancePort": 32697, 
            "LoadBalancerPort": 443, 
            "Protocol": "TCP", 
            "InstanceProtocol": "TCP"
          }, 
          "PolicyNames": []
        }
      ], 
      ...
      "Instances": [
        {
          "InstanceId": "i-063fabc7ad5935db5"
        },
        {
          "InstanceId": "i-04d32c91cfc084369"
        }
      ], 
      "DNSName": "a1c431cef1bfa11e88b600650be36f73-2136831960.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com", 
      ...
      "LoadBalancerName": "a1c431cef1bfa11e88b600650be36f73", 
      ...
```

We can observe from the output that a new load balancer was added.

The new load balancer publishes port 80 (HTTP) and maps it to 31895. That port is the same the ingress-nginx Service published. Similarly, the LB published port 443 (HTTPS) and mapped it to 32697. From the Instances section, we can see that it currently maps to the two worker nodes.

Further down, we can see the DNSName. We should retrieve it but, unfortunately, LoadBalancerName does not follow any format. However, we do know that now there are two load balancers and that the one dedicated to masters has a name that starts with api-devops23. So, we can retrieve the other LB by specifying that it should not contain that prefix. We’ll use jq's instruction not for that.

The command that retrieves DNS from the new load balancer is as follows.

```shell
CLUSTER_DNS=$(aws elb \
    describe-load-balancers | jq -r \
    ".LoadBalancerDescriptions[] \
    | select(.DNSName \
    | contains (\"api-devops23\") \
    | not).DNSName")
```
