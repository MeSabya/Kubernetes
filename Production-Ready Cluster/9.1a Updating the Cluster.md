Editing the Definition#
With kops, we cannot update the cluster directly. Instead, we edit the desired state of the cluster stored, in our case, in the S3 bucket. Once the state is changed, kops will make the necessary changes to comply with the new desire.

We’ll try to update the cluster so that the number of worker nodes is increased from one to two. In other words, we want to add one more server to the cluster.

The kops edit Commands#
Let’s see the sub-commands provided through kops edit.

Edit Cluster#
You might think that cluster would provide the possibility to create a new worker node. However, that is not the case. If you execute kops edit cluster --name $NAME, you’ll see that nothing in the configuration indicates how many nodes we should have. That is normal considering that we should not create servers in AWS directly. Just as Kubernetes, AWS also prefers a declarative approach over imperative. At least, when dealing with EC2 instances.

Edit Instance Group#
Instead of sending an imperative instruction to create a new node, we’ll change the value of the Auto-Scaling Group (ASG) related to worker nodes. Once we change ASG values, AWS will make sure that it complies with the new desire. It’ll not only create a new server to comply with the new ASG sizes, but it will also monitor EC2 instances and maintain the desired number in case one of them fails.

So, we’ll choose the third kops edit option.

We executed kops edit ig command, where ig is one of the aliases of instancegroup. We specified the name of the cluster with the --name argument. Finally, we set the type of the servers to nodes. As a result, we are presented with the InstanceGroup config for the Auto-Scaling Group associated with worker nodes.

The output is as follows.

Bear in mind that what you’re seeing on the screen is not the standard output (stdout). Instead, the configuration is opened in your default editor. In our case, that is vi.

We can see some useful information from this config.

Line 9: The image used to create EC2 instances is based on Debian. It is custom made for kops.

Line 10: The machineType represents EC2 size which is set to t2.small.

Line 17-19: We’re running the VMs in three subnets or since we’re in AWS, three availability zones.

Line 11-12: The parts of the config we care about are the spec entries maxSize and minSize. Both are set to 1 since that is the number of worker nodes we specified when we created the cluster. Please change the values of those two entries to 2, save, and exit.

The below figure illustrates the working of kops edit command.

Updating the Definition#
Now that we changed the configuration, we need to tell kops that we want it to update the cluster to comply with the new desired state.

We can see that kops set our kubectl context to the cluster we updated. There was no need for that since that was already our context, but it did that anyway. Further on, we got the confirmation that the changes have been applied to the cloud.

The last sentence is interesting. It informed us that we can use kops rolling-update. The kops update command applies all the changes to the cluster at once. That can result in downtime.

Actually, the kops rolling-update command intends to apply the changes without downtime. It would apply them to one server at the time so that most of the servers are always running. In parallel, Kubernetes would be rescheduling the Pods that were running on the servers that were brought down.

As long as our applications are scaled, kops rolling-update should not produce downtime.

In the next lesson, we will go through the sequential breakdown and verification of the cluster updating process.
