# Why we need Kubernetes High Availability?
*Kubernetes High-Availability is about setting up Kubernetes, along with its supporting components in a way that there is no single point of failure. A single master cluster can easily fail, while a multi-master cluster uses multiple master nodes, each of which has access to same worker nodes. In a single master cluster the important component like API server, controller manager lies only on the single master node and if it fails you cannot create more services, pods etc. However, in case of Kubernetes HA environment, these important components are replicated on multiple masters(usually three masters) and if any of the masters fail, the other masters keep the cluster up and running.*

# Advantages of multi-master

In the Kubernetes cluster, the master node manages the etcd database, API server, controller manager, and scheduler, along with all the worker nodes. What if we have only a single master node and if that node fails, all the worker nodes will be unscheduled and the cluster will be lost.

In a multi-master setup, by contrast, a multi-master provides high availability for a single cluster by running multiple apiserver, etcd, controller-manager, and schedulers. This does not only provides redundancy but also improves network performance because all the masters are dividing the load among themselves.

A multi-master setup protects against a wide range of failure modes, from a loss of a single worker node to the failure of the master node’s etcd service. By providing redundancy, a multi-master cluster serves as a highly available system for your end-users.

Master Node: Each master node in a multi-master environment run its’ own copy of Kube API server. This can be used for load balancing among the master nodes. Master node also runs its copy of the etcd database, which stores all the data of cluster. In addition to API server and etcd database, the master node also runs k8s controller manager, which handles replication and scheduler, which schedules pods to nodes.

Worker Node: Like single master in the multi-master cluster also the worker runs their own component mainly orchestrating pods in the Kubernetes cluster. We need 3 machines which satisfy the Kubernetes master requirement and 3 machines which satisfy the Kubernetes worker requirement.
