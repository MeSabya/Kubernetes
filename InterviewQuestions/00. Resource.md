# What is the difference between requests and limits in Kubernetes? How do they affect scheduling? How are they enforced at runtime?

In Kubernetes, requests and limits are resource constraints you can define for a container in a Pod. 
They are used to manage CPU and memory (RAM) resources efficiently across a cluster.

## 1. What are Requests and Limits?
### Requests
Definition: The minimum amount of CPU or memory that the container is guaranteed to get.

Usage: Used by the Kube scheduler to decide where to place a Pod.

Think of it as: ‚ÄúI need at least this much to work properly.‚Äù

### Limits
Definition: The maximum amount of CPU or memory that the container can use.

Usage: Enforced at runtime by the container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O).

Think of it as: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not allowed to use more than this.‚Äù

## 2. How Do They Affect Scheduling?
During Scheduling:
The Kubernetes scheduler only looks at requests (not limits) when deciding which node to place a Pod on.

It tries to find a node where the sum of all requested resources (plus this new Pod) fits within the node‚Äôs available allocatable resources.

Example:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "1000m"
```

In the above:

- Scheduler assumes this Pod needs 128Mi memory and 250 millicores CPU.
- It doesn‚Äôt consider the limits (512Mi/1000m) during scheduling.

## 3. How Are They Enforced at Runtime?
- ‚úÖ Enforced by the container runtime and cgroups (Linux control groups)
- üß† Memory:
- If usage exceeds the memory limit ‚Üí the container is terminated (OOMKilled).
- If usage is below the memory limit ‚Üí container can run without problems.
- No memory request specified? Kubernetes may not schedule reliably and might overcommit.

- ‚öôÔ∏è CPU:
- If usage exceeds the CPU limit ‚Üí the container is throttled, not killed.
- Throttling means the process is slowed down to stay within the limit.
- CPU requests ensure a certain amount of CPU shares (weighted access) but are not a hard reservation.

# Role of the Kubelet in Setting Resource Limits

## 1. Translates PodSpec to Container Runtime Instructions
When a Pod is scheduled to a node:

- The Kubelet reads the Pod's resources.requests and resources.limits from the PodSpec.
- It then communicates these to the container runtime (e.g., containerd, CRI-O) as part of the container creation process.
- ‚û°Ô∏è These get translated into Linux cgroup (control group) settings.

## 2. Creates Cgroups with Limits
For each container:

- The Kubelet sets up or requests the runtime to set up cgroups that:
- Enforce CPU shares and CPU quotas
- Enforce memory limits
- This ensures that the container:
- Cannot use more than the memory limit (memory.max)
- Will be throttled if it exceeds the CPU limit (cpu.cfs_quota_us, cpu.cfs_period_us)

## 3. Monitors Resource Usage
- The Kubelet constantly monitors running containers using:
- The cAdvisor component (integrated inside the Kubelet)
- /sys/fs/cgroup and /proc to check actual usage
- This helps:
- Report metrics to the API server (used by kubectl top, HPA, etc.)
- Decide if a container should be evicted during resource pressure

## 4. Enforces Pod Eviction Policies
If a node is under memory pressure, the Kubelet:

Evicts lower-priority Pods (based on QoS classes)

Logs Eviction events

Triggers rescheduling if needed

# What is QoS in Kubernetes?
QoS classes determine how Kubernetes treats your Pod when the node is under resource pressure, like low memory or high CPU usage.

There are three QoS classes, and they depend on how you define requests and limits in your Pod's containers.

## üß™ Analogy
Imagine three kinds of passengers on a plane:

- Guaranteed = First-class passenger (paid fully)
- Burstable = Economy passenger (paid partially)
- BestEffort = Standby passenger (free ticket)

When there's limited food or seats:

- First-class gets it first
- Economy may get some
- Standby can be kicked off

### ‚úÖ 1. Guaranteed
Condition:

Every container in the Pod has equal requests and limits for both CPU and memory

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "256Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "256Mi"
```

Behavior:

Kubernetes guarantees these resources

Pod won‚Äôt be throttled or evicted unless absolutely necessary

üìå Best possible treatment

### üü° 2. Burstable
Condition:

At least one container has a request

But limit is higher than request, or not set

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "256Mi"
```

Behavior:

Gets at least the requested amount

Can burst up to the limit if resources are available

Can be evicted before Guaranteed pods

üìå Good treatment, but not guaranteed

### 3. BestEffort
Condition:

No requests or limits set for any container

```yaml
# No resource section
```

Behavior:

No guaranteed CPU or memory

First to be evicted if the node is full

Very low priority
