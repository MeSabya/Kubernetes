## Inspect how a kubelet is configured 

Kubelet configuration files path can be found using the command:

```bash
ps aux | grep kubelet
```

### What is kubeconfig and only config file from the output of the above command

In the context of the kubelet process in Kubernetes, the terms "kubeconfig" and "config file" refer to configuration files that provide settings 
and authentication information for the kubelet to interact with the Kubernetes control plane. These files help define how the kubelet communicates 
with the API server, authenticates itself, and performs various operations within the cluster.

#### Here's a basic example of a kubeconfig file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: my-cluster
  cluster:
    server: https://api-server.example.com
    certificate-authority: /path/to/ca.pem
users:
- name: my-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /path/to/client-cert.pem
    client-key: /path/to/client-key.pem
contexts:
- name: my-context
  context:
    cluster: my-cluster
    user: my-user
current-context: my-context
```

#### Kubelet Configuration File:
The kubelet process can be configured using a configuration file, and it may include settings related to the kubelet's behavior, authentication, and interaction with the Kubernetes API server.

Here's a simplified example of a kubelet configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: KubeletConfiguration
hostnameOverride: my-node
authentication:
  x509:
    clientCAFile: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
authorization:
  mode: Webhook
clusterDomain: cluster.local
```
