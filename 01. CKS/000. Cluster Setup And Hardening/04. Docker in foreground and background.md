## Two different ways to start the Docker daemon

dockerd and systemctl start docker are two different ways to start the Docker daemon, and they are often used in different contexts. 
Let's break down each of them:

### dockerd:
dockerd is the Docker daemon itself. 
Running this command starts the Docker daemon as a foreground process in the current terminal. It's a direct command to start the Docker engine.

By default, the Docker daemon is configured to start automatically when your system boots up. 
Running dockerd manually is typically not necessary for regular usage but can be useful for debugging or troubleshooting.

### systemctl start docker:

systemctl is a Linux command for controlling the systemd system and service manager. 
When you run systemctl start docker, you are using systemd to start the Docker daemon as a background service.

This command is commonly used on Linux systems (such as those using systemd, like many modern distributions) to start the Docker daemon as a background service. 
It ensures that the Docker daemon runs in the background, even if you close the terminal.

### In summary:

- Use dockerd if you want to start the Docker daemon in the foreground for debugging or troubleshooting purposes. It's more of a direct and manual way to start the Docker daemon.

- Use systemctl start docker if you are on a Linux system with systemd and you want to start the Docker daemon as a background service. This is the typical way to start Docker in a production or everyday usage scenario.

## Sysctl commands to start docker in background

```
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```

## Dockerd commands and details 

### What is /var/run/docker.sock file in dockerd
The /var/run/docker.sock file is a Unix socket that the Docker daemon listens on by default. It serves as the communication endpoint for Docker API requests. 
Docker clients, 
such as the Docker command-line interface (CLI) or applications using Docker APIs, communicate with the Docker daemon over this socket.

### What is the meaning of this command: dockerd --debug --host=tcp://192.168.1.10:2375 
✔ --debug: This option starts the Docker daemon in debug mode. Debug mode provides more detailed and verbose output, 
which helps troubleshoot and diagnose issues. When the Docker daemon is started with this option, 
it prints more information to the console about its internal operations, including details about API requests and responses.

✔ --host=tcp://192.168.1.10:2375: This option specifies the network address on which the Docker daemon should listen for Docker API requests. 
In this case, it is configured to listen on TCP at the IP address 192.168.1.10 and port 2375. By default, 
Docker daemon communicates over a Unix socket (unix:///var/run/docker.sock), but this option explicitly enables Docker to listen on a TCP socket.

**However, it's important to note the security implications of exposing the Docker daemon over the network:**

- Security Considerations:
Exposing the Docker daemon over TCP without proper security measures can pose security risks. 
Unauthorized access to the Docker daemon could lead to control over the host system. 
It's recommended to use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the communication between the Docker client and daemon when exposing it over the network

## Docker daemon configuration file 
On Linux, the Docker daemon configuration file is often found at /etc/docker/daemon.json. If this file doesn't exist by default, you can create it.
