### Solution
There are two types of traffic :
      1. Ingress (Traffic incoming to the POD)
      2. Egress  (Traffic going out of the POD)

For the given problem we need to set up an Egress traffic on the Internal pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: internal-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: internal
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  - Ingress
  ingress:
    - {}
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: mysql
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306

  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: payroll
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080

  - ports:
    - port: 53
      protocol: UDP
    - port: 53
      protocol: TCP
```
