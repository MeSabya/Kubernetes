## Problem-1
Create a network policy to allow traffic from the Internal application only to the payroll-service and db-service.

### Solution
There are two types of traffic :
      1. Ingress (Traffic incoming to the POD)
      2. Egress  (Traffic going out of the POD)

For the given problem we need to set up an Egress traffic on the Internal pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: internal-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      name: internal
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  - Ingress
  ingress:
    - {}
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: mysql
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306

  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: payroll
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080

  - ports:
    - port: 53
      protocol: UDP
    - port: 53
      protocol: TCP
```

## Problem2:

Suppose we need to configure a network policy in DB POD to allow traffic from API pod which is only running in prod namespace.

## Problem3:
Extending the problem2, suppose we need configure network policy so that we also wanted to allow trafic from external backup server also.
Something similar to this we can do:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-specific-ip
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - ipBlock:
        cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
```
