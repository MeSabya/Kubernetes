## So tls = true and tlsverify=true both option needs to be there in the daemon.json file? 

- **tls**:
When tls is set to true, it indicates that the Docker daemon should listen for secure (encrypted) communication over TLS. This means that TLS is enabled for the Docker daemon.

- **tlsverify**:
When tlsverify is set to true, it indicates that the Docker client should use TLS when connecting to the Docker daemon. It enforces secure communication between the Docker client and the Docker daemon.

```bash
{
  "tls": true,
  "tlscert": "/path/to/server-cert.pem",
  "tlskey": "/path/to/server-key.pem",
  "tlscacert": "/path/to/ca.pem",
  "tlsverify": true
}
```
This configuration ensures that both the Docker daemon and client are configured for secure communication using TLS. The daemon uses TLS for incoming connections, 
and the client enforces TLS when interacting with the daemon.

## why we need these 3 files :

```bash
"tlscert": "/path/to/server-cert.pem",
"tlskey": "/path/to/server-key.pem",
"tlscacert": "/path/to/ca.pem"
```

### tlscert:

This file specifies the path to the server certificate (server-cert.pem). The server certificate is presented by the Docker daemon to clients during the TLS handshake process. 
It contains the public key of the Docker daemon and is signed by the Certificate Authority (CA).

### tlskey:

This file specifies the path to the private key corresponding to the server certificate (server-key.pem). 
The private key is kept confidential on the Docker server and is used for decrypting messages encrypted with the public key of the server certificate.

### tlscacert:

This file specifies the path to the CA certificate (ca.pem). The CA certificate is the root certificate that signs both the server certificate and client certificates. It acts as a trust anchor, allowing clients to verify the authenticity of the server certificate during the TLS handshake.
