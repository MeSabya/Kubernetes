## How Asymmetric encryption works 

Asymmetric encryption involves a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.

Here's a basic overview of how SSH asymmetric encryption works:

#### Key Generation:

The user generates a key pair on their local machine, typically using the ssh-keygen command.
This process creates a public key and a private key. The public key is stored in a file (usually with a .pub extension), and the private key is kept securely on the user's machine.

And the trick here is if some confidential data is encrypted using the public key then it can only be decrypted using the private key.

#### Key Distribution:

The user's public key needs to be placed on the server they want to access. This is often done by appending the contents of the public key file to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server.
Each user who needs access to the server needs to repeat this process, adding their public key to the server's authorized_keys file.

#### Connection Establishment:

When a user attempts to connect to the server, the server sends a challenge to the client.
The client signs the challenge with its private key.

#### Verification:

The server, having the user's public key, can verify the signature using the public key.
If the signature is valid, the server grants access to the client.

### Now suppose i want access github using ssh keys .. what needs to be done 

To access GitHub using SSH keys, you need to follow these general steps:

#### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair:
If you don't have an SSH key pair on your local machine, you need to generate one. Open a terminal and use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Replace "your_email@example.com" with the email associated with your GitHub account. Press Enter to accept the default file location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) and set a passphrase for additional security if you wish.

#### 2. Add SSH Key to SSH Agent:
If you are using an SSH agent, add your private key to it to facilitate key management:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### 3. Copy Public Key to GitHub:
Copy the content of your public key to your clipboard. You can use the following command to display and copy the key:

``` bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then, go to your GitHub account:

Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "Settings."
In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys."
Click on "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key."
Give your SSH key a descriptive title and paste the key into the "Key" field.
Click "Add SSH key."

#### 4. Test the SSH Connection:
To verify that your SSH key is set up correctly, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## TLS and SSH asymmetric encryption both are related?

TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSH (Secure Shell) both use asymmetric encryption, but they are distinct protocols with different purposes.

Purpose:

TLS (SSL): TLS is primarily designed for securing communication over a network. It is commonly used to secure web traffic, providing a secure connection between a client (typically a web browser) and a server (web server).
SSH: SSH is designed for secure remote access to systems and secure file transfers. It allows users to log into another computer over a network, execute commands in a remote machine, and move files from one machine to another.
Use of Asymmetric Encryption:

TLS (SSL): In TLS, asymmetric encryption is often used during the initial stages of a connection for key exchange and authentication. Once a secure connection is established, symmetric encryption is commonly employed for data transfer due to its efficiency.
SSH: SSH relies on asymmetric encryption for key exchange and user authentication during the initial stages of the connection. Similar to TLS, SSH often switches to symmetric encryption for the actual data transfer once the initial secure connection is established.
Port Numbers:

TLS (SSL): Typically uses port 443 for secure HTTPS connections.
SSH: Typically uses port 22 for secure remote access.
Protocol Stack:

TLS (SSL): Part of the broader Internet security protocol stack, operating at the transport layer (Layer 4) or sometimes at the application layer (Layer 7).
SSH: Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and is specifically designed for secure remote access.
While TLS and SSH have different use cases, they both leverage asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange and authentication. However, the details of their implementations, key exchange algorithms, and the specific cryptographic protocols they use may vary.
