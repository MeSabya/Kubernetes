## How Asymmetric encryption works 

Asymmetric encryption involves a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is shared openly, while the private key is kept secret.

Here's a basic overview of how SSH asymmetric encryption works:

#### Key Generation:

The user generates a key pair on their local machine, typically using the ssh-keygen command.
This process creates a public key and a private key. The public key is stored in a file (usually with a .pub extension), and the private key is kept securely on the user's machine.

And the trick here is if some confidential data is encrypted using the public key then it can only be decrypted using the private key.

#### Key Distribution:

The user's public key needs to be placed on the server they want to access. This is often done by appending the contents of the public key file to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the server.
Each user who needs access to the server needs to repeat this process, adding their public key to the server's authorized_keys file.

#### Connection Establishment:

When a user attempts to connect to the server, the server sends a challenge to the client.
The client signs the challenge with its private key.

#### Verification:

The server, having the user's public key, can verify the signature using the public key.
If the signature is valid, the server grants access to the client.

### Now suppose i want access github using ssh keys .. what needs to be done 

To access GitHub using SSH keys, you need to follow these general steps:

#### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair:
If you don't have an SSH key pair on your local machine, you need to generate one. Open a terminal and use the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Replace "your_email@example.com" with the email associated with your GitHub account. Press Enter to accept the default file location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) and set a passphrase for additional security if you wish.

#### 2. Add SSH Key to SSH Agent:
If you are using an SSH agent, add your private key to it to facilitate key management:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

#### 3. Copy Public Key to GitHub:
Copy the content of your public key to your clipboard. You can use the following command to display and copy the key:

``` bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then, go to your GitHub account:

Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "Settings."
In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys."
Click on "New SSH key" or "Add SSH key."
Give your SSH key a descriptive title and paste the key into the "Key" field.
Click "Add SSH key."

#### 4. Test the SSH Connection:
To verify that your SSH key is set up correctly, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```
