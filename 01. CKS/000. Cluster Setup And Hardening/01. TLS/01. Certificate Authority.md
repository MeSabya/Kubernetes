## Certificate authority in K8 cluster

- In a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, the Certificate Authority (CA) is a crucial component that plays a central role in establishing a secure communication infrastructure. The CA is responsible for issuing digital
  certificates that authenticate the identity of various components within the cluster.

- In a typical Kubernetes cluster, the master node (specifically, the Kubernetes control plane components) acts as a Certificate Authority (CA) to issue X.509 certificates for various purposes within the cluster. The CA
  functionality is implemented as part of the Kubernetes control plane to provide secure communication and authentication between different components.

- In a Kubernetes master node, the component responsible for signing and approving certificates is the kube-controller-manager. The kube-controller-manager is one of the core components of the Kubernetes control plane, 
  and it includes a controller called the CSR (Certificate Signing Request) controller that manages certificate signing operations.

Here's how the CSR process works:

#### CSR Controller:

The CSR controller is part of the kube-controller-manager.
It watches for Certificate Signing Request (CSR) objects created in the cluster.

#### Certificate Signing Request (CSR):

When a component or entity in the cluster needs a certificate, it creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) object.
The CSR includes information about the public key for which the certificate is requested.

#### API Server Approval:

The CSR is submitted to the Kubernetes API server.
The CSR controller, as part of the kube-controller-manager, watches for new CSRs.
The API server, based on configured policies and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), approves or denies the CSR.

#### Certificate Signing:

If the CSR is approved, the CSR controller generates a signed certificate for the requested public key.
The signed certificate is then stored in a Kubernetes Secret associated with the CSR.

#### Components Use Issued Certificates:

The component or entity requesting the certificate can now retrieve the issued certificate from the associated Secret.
The certificate can be used for secure communication within the Kubernetes cluster.


Here are key aspects of the Certificate Authority in a Kubernetes cluster:

### CA Components:

The CA consists of a pair of cryptographic keys: the CA private key (ca.key) and the CA certificate (ca.crt).

    ca.key: This is the private key used for signing certificates.
    ca.crt: This is the public key certificate that is distributed and trusted by components within the cluster.

### Default Self-Signed CA:

By default, when you initialize a new Kubernetes cluster using tools like kubeadm or other cluster provisioning methods, a self-signed CA is automatically generated. This self-signed CA is used for securing communication within the cluster.

### Location of CA Files:

The CA files are typically stored in the directory specified by the --cert-dir flag during cluster initialization. The default directory is often /etc/kubernetes/pki/.

### Certificate Issuance:

The CA issues certificates for various components in the cluster, including:
Nodes (worker nodes) receive certificates to authenticate themselves to the Kubernetes API server.
The Kubernetes API server itself has a certificate signed by the CA.
Other components like etcd and Ingress controllers may also have certificates issued by the CA.


## how TLS work with these ca.key , ca,crt?

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that ensures secure communication over a computer network. In the context of Kubernetes (K8s), TLS is commonly used to encrypt communication between different components in the cluster. The files ca.key, ca.csr, and ca.crt are associated with the Certificate Authority (CA) that is used to issue and verify TLS certificates within the Kubernetes cluster.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how TLS works with these files in the context of Kubernetes:

#### Key Generation:

The process begins with the generation of a pair of cryptographic keysâ€”a private key (ca.key) and a public key. The private key must be kept secure and should only be known to the Certificate Authority.
Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Generation:

A Certificate Signing Request (ca.csr) is then generated. This CSR contains information about the entity (in this case, the Kubernetes cluster) requesting a certificate, including the public key.
Certificate Signing:

The CSR is sent to the Certificate Authority, which verifies the identity of the requester and signs the CSR using its private key. The result is a digital certificate (ca.crt). The CA's digital signature on the certificate ensures the authenticity of the certificate.

#### Certificate Distribution:

The signed certificate (ca.crt) is distributed to the entities that need to establish secure communication within the Kubernetes cluster. In the case of K8s, these entities could include the Kubernetes API server, nodes, and other components.

#### TLS Handshake:

When two entities in the Kubernetes cluster want to communicate securely (e.g., a node communicating with the API server), a TLS handshake is initiated. During the handshake, the entities exchange information, including their certificates.

#### Certificate Verification:

The receiving entity (e.g., the API server) uses the CA's public key (contained in ca.crt) to verify the authenticity of the incoming certificate. If the certificate is valid and signed by the CA, the communication proceeds.

#### Secure Communication:

Once the certificates are verified, the entities establish a secure communication channel using encryption algorithms negotiated during the TLS handshake. This ensures that data transmitted between them is confidential and secure from tampering.

In summary, the CA's private key (ca.key) is used to sign certificates, and the corresponding public key (ca.crt) is used to verify the authenticity of certificates during the TLS handshake. This process ensures a secure and trusted communication environment within the Kubernetes cluster.

TLS involves a series of handshakes to establish a secure connection. Let's break down the terms you mentioned in the context of TLS handshaking in Kubernetes:

#### Root Certificates:

Root certificates are the foundation of the certificate chain. They are self-signed certificates that are used to verify the authenticity of other certificates in the chain.
In Kubernetes, root certificates are often used by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to sign the intermediate certificates, which are then used to sign the end-entity certificates (like server and client certificates).

#### Client Certificates:

Client certificates are used to authenticate the identity of a client (e.g., a Kubernetes worker node) to a server (e.g., the Kubernetes API server).
In Kubernetes, client certificates are often used for securing communication between different components, such as between kubelets (on worker nodes) and the Kubernetes API server.

#### Server Certificates:

Server certificates are used to authenticate the identity of a server (e.g., the Kubernetes API server) to a client (e.g., a kubelet).
In Kubernetes, server certificates are crucial for securing the communication between different components. For example, the Kubernetes API server uses a server certificate to prove its identity to kubelets and other components.

In the above kube-api-server is acting both as a client and server. Kube-api-server is acting as a server for all the worker nodes and it acts as a client for etcd server and kubelet server.
Kube-api server is the only resource which can interact with etcd , so it must act as a client.
