# How pod is authenticated by api-server

## 1. Pod Certificate and Key Generation:

### A. Pod Identity:

Each pod is given a unique identity, typically based on its namespace, pod name, and 
service account.

**Create a Service account**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: my-service-account
```

**Create a Role and RoleBinding for the Service Account**

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]

---

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pod-reader-binding
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: my-service-account
  namespace: default
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

### B. Generate Pod Certificate and Key:

For the pod, generate a unique certificate and private key pair. This certificate should be signed by the CA.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out pod-key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key pod-key.pem -subj "/CN=my-pod" -out pod.csr
openssl x509 -req -in pod.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out pod.pem -days 365
```

**Explanation of the above commands:**

#### Generate RSA Private Key:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out pod-key.pem 2048
```
This command generates an RSA private key (pod-key.pem) with a key size of 2048 bits. 
The private key is an essential component in asymmetric cryptography and is used for both signing and decrypting data.

#### Create Certificate Signing Request (CSR):

```bash
openssl req -new -key pod-key.pem -subj "/CN=my-pod" -out pod.csr
```

This command creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) (pod.csr) using the private key generated in the first step. 
The CSR contains information about the entity (in this case, a "pod") requesting a digital certificate. 
The subject (-subj) is set to "/CN=my-pod", indicating the Common Name (CN) for the certificate.

#### Sign the CSR to Generate a Certificate:

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in pod.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -out pod.pem -days 365
```
This command takes the CSR (pod.csr) and signs it using a Certificate Authority (CA). 
The CA's public key and private key are specified with -CA and -CAkey, respectively. 
The resulting certificate (pod.pem) is valid for 365 days (-days 365). The CAcreateserial option ensures that a serial number is created for the certificate.

#### Store Pod Certificate:

Store the generated pod certificate and key in a Kubernetes Secret.
```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-pod-secret --from-file=pod.pem --from-file=pod-key
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-pod-secret
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  tls.crt: BASE64_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE
  tls.key: BASE64_ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY
ca.crt: BASE64_ENCODED_CA_CERTIFICATE
```

## 2. Pod Deployment:
Pod Configuration:

When deploying the pod, configure it to use the pod certificate and key for TLS communication.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: my-service-account
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: tls-certs
      mountPath: /etc/my-app/tls
volumes:
- name: tls-certs
  secret:
    secretName: my-pod-secret
```

## 3. API Server Configuration:
Configure API Server:
The Kubernetes API server is configured to verify incoming requests' certificates against the CA certificate.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kube-apiserver
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kube-apiserver
    image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver
    command:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --tls-cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.crt
    - --tls-private-key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/apiserver.key
    - --client-ca-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    # Other API server options...
  volumeMounts:
  - name: kube-apiserver-certs
    mountPath: /etc/kubernetes/pki
volumes:
- name: kube-apiserver-certs
  secret:
    secretName: my-ca-secret
```

## 4. Pod Authentication:

**Pod-to-API Server Communication:**
When the pod communicates with the API server (e.g., making an API request), it presents its certificate as part of the TLS handshake.

**CA Verification:**
The API server verifies the pod's certificate against the CA certificate. If the verification is successful, the pod is considered authenticated.

**Service Account Information:**
The API server extracts information from the pod's certificate, such as the Common Name (CN) or other subject fields, to determine the pod's identity.

**Authorization Checks:**
After authentication, the API server performs authorization checks based on the pod's identity and the requested API operation.

## Here's how the process works:

#### TLS Certificates:

TLS certificates are used to encrypt and secure the communication between the pod and the Kubernetes API server.
The TLS certificates include:

      Client Certificate (tls.crt): The public key of the client (pod).
      Client Private Key (tls.key): The private key corresponding to the client certificate.
      CA Certificate (ca.crt): The certificate of the Certificate Authority that signed the client certificate.

#### Service Account:

The Service Account associated with the pod provides an identity for the pod.
The Service Account is used for RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) authorization. 
The associated Role or ClusterRole defines what actions the pod is allowed to perform.

#### Pod Configuration:

The pod is configured to use a specific Service Account (my-service-account in this example) using the serviceAccountName field.
TLS certificates are stored in a Kubernetes Secret (my-tls-secret), and the pod mounts this secret as a volume.

### Authentication Flow:

- When the pod communicates with the Kubernetes API server, it presents its TLS client certificate (tls.crt) and public key (tls.key) during the TLS handshake.
- The Kubernetes API server validates the client certificate against the CA certificate (ca.crt) to ensure the identity of the pod.
- The associated Service Account (my-service-account) is used for RBAC authorization to determine what actions the pod is allowed to perform.

### RBAC Authorization:

The Service Account (my-service-account) is associated with a Role or ClusterRole, and a RoleBinding or 
ClusterRoleBinding grants permissions to that Service Account.
RBAC rules define what resources the pod can access and what actions it can perform.
By combining TLS certificates for secure communication and a Service Account for identity and RBAC authorization,
Kubernetes ensures that pods can securely communicate with the API server while having the appropriate permissions based on their identity. 
This helps in maintaining security and access control within the cluster.
