## View certificate details 
In order to view the certificates of an already-established cluster, we need to understand the way a k8s cluster is being created. 
K8s cluster can be created either by kubeadmin or the hard way. 

When the K8s cluster is setup using Kubeadmin all the control plane components are launched as stand-alone processes or pods. 
On the other hand, if it is set up using non kubeadmin way the control plane components are launched as systemd service.

For one of the control plane components, lets discuss on kube-apiserver:

**The kube-apiserver can be configured and run as a systemd service (kube-apiserver.service) or as a standalone process using a configuration file (kube-apiserver.yaml).**


### kube-apiserver.service:

- Systemd Service: On systems that use systemd (such as many Linux distributions), the kube-apiserver process is often managed as a systemd service.

- Service File (kube-apiserver.service): The systemd service file (kube-apiserver.service) contains configurations and options for running the kube-apiserver. It specifies how the service should be started, stopped, and
  managed by systemd.

- Location: The service file is typically located in the systemd service unit file directory. For example, on a system using systemd, you might find it in /etc/systemd/system/ or /etc/systemd/system/kube-apiserver.service.

- Configuration Parameters: Configuration parameters for the kube-API server service, such as API server flags and options, are often specified in the service file.

- Example: The kube-apiserver.service file might look something like this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Kubernetes API Server
Documentation=https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kube-apiserver/

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver --config=/etc/kubernetes/apiserver.yaml
Restart=always
User=kube
# ... other settings ...

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### kube-apiserver.yaml

- Configuration File: Alternatively, you can run the kube-apiserver as a standalone process by providing a configuration file (kube-apiserver.yaml). The configuration file specifies the various settings and parameters for 
  the API server.

- Location: The configuration file can be placed in a directory accessible to the kube-apiserver process. Common locations include /etc/kubernetes/ or a custom directory specified by the --config flag in the kube-
  apiserver.service file.

- Example: The kube-apiserver.yaml file contains configurations like API server flags, certificates, authorization modes, etc. A simple example might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kube-apiserver
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - kube-apiserver
    - --etcd-servers=http://etcd-server:2379
    - --service-cluster-ip-range=10.0.0.1/24
    - --insecure-port=8080
    # ... other settings ...
    image: k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver:v1.22.2
```

## Certificate viewing 

Assuming the cluster is built using kubeadmn , so lets analyse kube-apiserver.yaml:

## How to view the logs 

When you deploy a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm, the control plane components (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etc.) are typically run as standalone processes, and you can view their logs using the journalctl command or by inspecting the logs directly. The kubectl logs command is typically used for viewing logs of containers within pods, not for control plane components.

Here's a summary:

#### Control Plane Components:

Deployed as standalone processes.
Logs can be viewed using journalctl. For example:

```bash
journalctl -u kube-apiserver
```

#### Kubelet:

Also deployed as a standalone process.
Logs can be viewed using journalctl. For example:

```bash
journalctl -u kubelet
```
