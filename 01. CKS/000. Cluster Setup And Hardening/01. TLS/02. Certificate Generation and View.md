## View certificate details 
In order to view the certificates of an already-established cluster, we need to understand the way a k8s cluster is being created. 
K8s cluster can be created either by kubeadmin or the hard way. 

When the K8s cluster is setup using Kubeadmin all the control plane components are lunched as stand-alone processes or pods. 
On the other hand if it is setup using non kubeadmin way the control plane components are launched as systemd service.
