Tracing system calls of a process is a useful technique for debugging and understanding the behavior of a program. 
On Linux, the strace command is commonly used for this purpose.

      strace -p <PID>

If you want to use strace -c with the touch command to create /tmp/error.log, the command would look like this:

      strace -c touch /tmp/error.log

```

## Seccomp in restricting syscalls 

Seccomp (Secure Computing Mode) is a feature in the Linux kernel that allows you to restrict the system calls available to a process. This can be useful for improving the security of applications, particularly in containerized environments like Docker. Seccomp helps to reduce the attack surface by blocking unnecessary or potentially dangerous system calls.

**Here's how you can use Seccomp in Docker:**

### Seccomp Profiles:
Docker supports two types of Seccomp profiles: default profiles and custom profiles.

- Default Profiles: Docker includes default Seccomp profiles for containers, such as docker/default and docker/blacklist. These profiles are designed to be 
  restrictive and reduce the risk of certain types of attacks.

- Custom Profiles: You can create your own custom Seccomp profiles to further tailor the system call restrictions for your containers.

### Using Default Seccomp Profiles:

      docker run --security-opt seccomp=unconfined my_container

### Creating Custom Seccomp Profiles:
To create a custom Seccomp profile, you need to define the allowed or denied system calls in a JSON file. Here's an example JSON file that allows only a specific set of system calls:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
  "architectures": ["amd64"],
  "syscalls": [
    {"names": ["write", "read", "exit"], "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"},
    {"names": ["open"], "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO"}
  ]
}
```
This example allows the write, read, and exit system calls, but denies the open system call. Save this JSON file, e.g., as my_profile.json.

      docker run --security-opt seccomp=my_profile.json my_container

## Seccomp in Kubernetes 

### 1. Define a Seccomp Profile:
Create a Seccomp profile in JSON format that defines the allowed or denied system calls for your container. Save this file, e.g., seccomp-profile.json. Here's a simple example that allows only a few specific system calls:

```json
{
  "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW",
  "syscalls": [
    {"names": ["read", "write", "exit"], "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW"},
    {"names": ["socket"], "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO"}
  ]
}
```
### 2. Attach Seccomp Profile to a Pod:
In your pod specification, specify the seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod annotation with the path to your Seccomp profile file. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
  annotations:
    seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/pod: /path/to/seccomp-profile.json
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage:latest
    # ... other container settings

```
Inside the container, you can attempt to execute various commands and observe if any system calls are denied based on your Seccomp profile.

### Another way to Attach a Seccomp Profile to a Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: Localhost
      localhostProfile: /path/to/seccomp-profile.json
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: myimage:latest
    # ... other container settings
```
### What is the default Seccomp profile location in this cluster?

Seccomp profile location by default is set to /var/lib/kubelet/seccomp.

Just for knowledge: the default manifest files for control plane components are typically stored in the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.
