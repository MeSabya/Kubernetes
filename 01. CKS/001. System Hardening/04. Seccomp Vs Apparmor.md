## Summary of Differences:

### Use Cases:
- Seccomp is well-suited for scenarios where specific system calls need to be restricted.
- AppArmor is suitable for scenarios where the overall behavior of an application needs to be confined, controlling file access, networking, and capabilities.

### Default Mode:
- Seccomp defaults to a "deny" mode, and you explicitly allow certain system calls.
- AppArmor defaults to an "enforce" mode, and you explicitly define what an application is allowed to do.
