LOAD   = Reflects whether the unit definition was properly loaded.
ACTIVE = The high-level unit activation state, i.e. generalization of SUB.
SUB    = The low-level unit activation state, values depend on unit type.

23 loaded units listed. Pass --all to see loaded but inactive units, too.
To show all installed unit files use 'systemctl list-unit-files'.
```
## Which command can be used to list the kernel modules currently loaded on a system?
lsmod

## On the controlplane host, we have nginx service running which isn't needed on that system. Stop the nginx service and remove its service unit file. Make sure not to remove nginx package from the system.

- Find out the name of the unit file:

```bash
systemctl list-units --all | grep nginx
```

- Stop Nginx service:

```bash
systemctl stop nginx
```
- Find out the location of the service unit:
```bash
systemctl status nginx
```
- Remove the unit file:
```bash
rm /lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
```

## Suppose we want to blacklist a kernel module , for example module : evbug 
vim /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

change 
#blacklist evbug

## sysctl vs systemctl

### sysctl:
- Manages kernel parameters.
- Operates at the kernel level.
- Configuration is often done in /etc/sysctl.conf or /etc/sysctl.d/.

### systemctl:
- Manages services and the overall system state.
- Operates at the user space level.
- Works with the systemd init system.
- Configuration is often done in service-specific configuration files.

Examples:

To start a service: systemctl start service_name
To stop a service: systemctl stop service_name
To restart a service: systemctl restart service_name
To enable a service to start on boot: systemctl enable service_name
To disable a service from starting on boot: systemctl disable service_name
To check the status of a service: systemctl status service_name

In summary, sysctl is used for configuring kernel parameters, while systemctl is used for managing services and the overall system state in 
systems that use systemd as the init system. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts within a Linux system.
