## Security Context
While security contexts are primarily defined at the container level for fine-grained control, a Pod-level security context provides defaults that can simplify configuration across all containers in the Pod.

A Security Context is a configuration that defines security settings for a Pod or a container. It specifies various security-related attributes such as user IDs, group IDs, and Linux capabilities.

### Real-Time Use Cases for Security Context:
- Running Containers with Non-Root User: Enforce that containers run as a non-root user to minimize potential security risks.
- Adding Linux Capabilities: Allow specific capabilities needed by the container without granting full root privileges.
- File System Group Configuration: Ensure that volumes mounted by the Pod have the appropriate group permissions.
- Preventing Privilege Escalation: Prevent containers from gaining more privileges than initially assigned.
- Read-Only Root Filesystem: Enforce a read-only filesystem to prevent tampering with the container’s file system.

### Key Features and Use Cases:

#### Privileged Container
Using Docker privileged mode is a security risk because it grants a Docker container root capabilities to all devices on the host system. Running in privileged mode gives it the capabilities of it the host machine including control over the host’s kernel features and device access.  An attacker could even install a new instance of the Docker platform within the privileged container; essentially, this mode allows for running Docker inside Docker.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-privileged-allowed
  labels:
    app: nginx-privileged
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      privileged: false
```

#### Run as a Non-Root User:

Use Case: Ensure that containers do not run as the root user to minimize the potential impact of a container compromise.
Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: non-root-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```
#### Set Capabilities:

Use Case: Grant specific Linux capabilities to a container while dropping others to enforce the principle of least privilege.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: capabilities-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
        drop: ["ALL"]
```

#### Read-Only Filesystem:

Use Case: Enforce read-only file systems to prevent write access to the filesystem from within the container.
Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: readonly-fs-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

#### Why Use fsGroup?
- Setting fsGroup ensures that Kubernetes adjusts the group ownership of the volume to the specified fsGroup when the volume is mounted.
- This guarantees the container has the necessary permissions to write to the volume, even if the storage backend or provisioner didn’t configure it that way.

***Pod Spec Without fsGroup:***

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: no-fsgroup-example
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1001
    runAsGroup: 1001
  containers:
  - name: test-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: test-pvc
```
If the PV backing test-pvc is owned by root:root and has default permissions (0755), the container running as 1001:1001 will not be able to write to /data.
If the PV is configured with permissions allowing write access to group 1001 or "others" (e.g., 0777), the container can write.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: no-fsgroup-example
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1001
    runAsGroup: 1001
    fsGroup: 3000
  containers:
  - name: test-container
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /data
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: test-pvc
```


### Some Tricky Questions 
#### What happens if you set conflicting runAsUser values at the Pod and container levels?
Answer: The runAsUser value set at the container level takes precedence over the value set at the Pod level. Pod-level values act as defaults only when not overridden by individual containers.

#### What is the purpose of setting allowPrivilegeEscalation: false, and how does it differ from running as a non-root user?
Answer: allowPrivilegeEscalation: false prevents the container processes from gaining additional privileges (e.g., using the setuid binary). Running as a non-root user (runAsUser) ensures processes start with a restricted user ID but does not block privilege escalation if enabled.

#### Can a container run as a non-root user and still use privileged mode?
Answer: Yes, the runAsUser setting and privileged mode are independent. A container running as a non-root user can still request privileged mode, which grants full access to the host's devices.



## Example of PSA ..how it can be used , which all realtime usecases it solves.
Pod Security Admission (PSA) in Kubernetes enforces security standards at the namespace level, simplifying the management and enforcement of security policies.
Here’s how you can configure different levels of security for a namespace:

### Privileged:
Allows most capabilities and is the least restrictive.
Suitable for trusted workloads that need elevated permissions.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: privileged-namespace
  annotations:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.23
```

### Baseline:
Prevents known privilege escalations and disallows dangerous features.
Suitable for most applications that do not require elevated privileges.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: baseline-namespace
  annotations:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: baseline
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.23
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: baseline
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version: v1.23
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: baseline
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version: v1.23
```

### Restricted:
Enforces strict security settings.
Disallows privilege escalation, running as root, and requires read-only root filesystems.
Suitable for security-sensitive workloads.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: restricted-namespace
  annotations:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.23
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version: v1.23
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version: v1.23
```

### Explain this piece of code will do 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: restricted-namespace
  annotations:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.23
```
#### What This Does
1. Namespace Creation: Creates a namespace named restricted-namespace.
2. Pod Security Admission Enforcement: Applies the restricted Pod Security Admission policy to this namespace.
3. Enforcement Version: Specifies the PSA version to use (v1.23 in this case).

#### Problems It Solves
Strict Security Controls:

- Purpose: The restricted policy enforces the strictest security controls available in PSA.
- Security Measures:
- Disallows running containers as root.
- Prevents privilege escalation.
- Requires a read-only root filesystem.
- Disallows the use of host namespaces and networking.
- Enforces non-root user and group IDs.

Result: Ensures that only highly secure and compliant Pods can run in the namespace, reducing the attack surface.

## Example Scenario
Imagine a namespace secure-namespace where PSA enforces the restricted policy. This ensures that no Pod in this namespace can run as root or escalate privileges. However, a specific application within this namespace needs to add the NET_ADMIN capability to manage network settings.

### Namespace with PSA:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: secure-namespace
  annotations:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: v1.23
```

##### Pod with Security Context:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: net-admin-pod
  namespace: secure-namespace
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: network-manager
    image: network-manager-image
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
      runAsUser: 1000
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```


In this scenario:

PSA ensures that no Pod runs as root and that privilege escalation is disallowed at a namespace level.
Security Context is used to add the NET_ADMIN capability specifically to the network-manager container, while still adhering to the overall security posture enforced by PSA.
