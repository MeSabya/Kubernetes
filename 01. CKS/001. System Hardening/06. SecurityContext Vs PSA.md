## Security Context
A Security Context is a configuration that defines security settings for a Pod or a container. It specifies various security-related attributes such as user IDs, group IDs, and Linux capabilities.

### Key Features and Use Cases:

#### Run as a Non-Root User:

Use Case: Ensure that containers do not run as the root user to minimize the potential impact of a container compromise.
Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: non-root-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
    runAsGroup: 3000
    fsGroup: 2000
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```
#### Set Capabilities:

Use Case: Grant specific Linux capabilities to a container while dropping others to enforce the principle of least privilege.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: capabilities-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN"]
        drop: ["ALL"]
```

#### Read-Only Filesystem:

Use Case: Enforce read-only file systems to prevent write access to the filesystem from within the container.
Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: readonly-fs-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
    securityContext:
      readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```
