## Which state is AppArmor in as of the given Kubernetes version?

AppArmor is in beta state as of the given Kubernetes version.

## Load the AppArmor profile called custom-nginx on control plane node and make sure that it is in enforced mode.The profile file is called usr.sbin.nginx located in the default AppArmor profiles directory.

### Solution:
To load an AppArmor profile and set it to enforced mode, you can use the apparmor_parser and aa-enforce commands. Here are the steps to load the AppArmor profile named custom-nginx from the file usr.sbin.nginx:

#### 1. Navigate to the AppArmor Profiles Directory:

Go to the default AppArmor profiles directory, which is usually located at /etc/apparmor.d/.

    cd /etc/apparmor.d/

#### 2.Load the AppArmor Profile:

Use the apparmor_parser command to load the AppArmor profile from the specified file.

    sudo apparmor_parser -r -W usr.sbin.nginx

The -r flag reloads the profile, and the -W flag enables warnings.

#### 3.Verify the Loaded Profile:

Verify that the custom-nginx profile has been loaded.
      
      sudo apparmor_status
Look for the custom-nginx profile in the list of enforced profiles.

#### 4.Set the Profile to Enforced Mode:

Use the aa-enforce command to set the profile to enforced mode.

    sudo aa-enforce usr.sbin.nginx
This command enforces the specified profile, ensuring that processes running under the profile are restricted by AppArmor rules.
Verify Enforced Mode:

#### 5.Verify that the profile is in enforced mode.

    sudo aa-status

Look for the custom-nginx profile in the list, and ensure that it is in enforced mode.
This sequence of commands assumes that the AppArmor profile file usr.sbin.nginx is correctly located in the /etc/apparmor.d/ directory. Please replace paths accordingly if your system has a different configuration.
