## Which state is AppArmor in as of the given Kubernetes version?

AppArmor is in beta state as of the given Kubernetes version.

## Usecases
### 1. Restricting File System Access
Example: Limit a web server to read-only access to specific directories.

```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile webserver-profile flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  # Allow read-only access to /var/www
  /var/www/ r,
  /var/www/** r,

  # Deny write access to everything
  deny /** w,

  # Allow necessary capabilities
  capability net_bind_service,
}
```
### 2. Limiting Network Access
Example: Prevent an application from making network connections.

```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile deny-network flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  # Deny all network access
  deny network inet,
  deny network inet6,
}
```
### 3. Constraining Process Execution
Example: Allow a script to execute only specific binaries.

```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile myscript-profile flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  # Allow execution of specific binaries
  /usr/bin/curl ixr,
  /usr/bin/grep ixr,

  # Deny execution of all other binaries
  deny /** x,
}
```
### 4. Restricting System Calls
Example: Deny an application from using certain system calls.
```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile myapp-profile flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  # Deny use of specific system calls
  deny ptrace,
  deny mount,
}
```
### 5. Enforcing Resource Limits
Example: Prevent an application from accessing certain devices.

```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile myapp-resource-limits flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  # Deny access to /dev/sda
  deny /dev/sda rw,
}
```
### 6. Securing Containers
Example: Apply AppArmor profiles to Kubernetes pods to restrict container capabilities and access.

#### Create AppArmor profile:
```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile container-restrictions flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  # Restrict capabilities
  deny capability sys_admin,
  deny capability sys_module,

  # Restrict network access
  deny network inet,
  deny network inet6,

  # Restrict file system access
  deny /proc/* rw,
  deny /sys/** rw,
}
```
#### Load the AppArmor profile on the node:
```shell
sudo apparmor_parser -r -W /etc/apparmor.d/container-restrictions
```
#### Apply the profile to a Kubernetes pod:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: restricted-container
  annotations:
    container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/restricted-container: localhost/container-restrictions
spec:
  containers:
  - name: restricted-container
    image: nginx:latest
```

### 7. Isolating Services
Example: Isolate a database service to limit its access to only necessary resources.

```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile mysql-profile flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>
  #include <abstractions/mysql>

  # Allow read/write access to database files
  /var/lib/mysql/ r,
  /var/lib/mysql/** rwk,

  # Deny access to all other file systems
  deny /home/** rw,
  deny /media/** rw,
  deny /mnt/** rw,
  deny /tmp/** rw,
}
```
### 8. Preventing Information Leakage
Example: Prevent an application from reading sensitive files.

```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile myapp-deny-sensitive-files flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  # Deny read access to sensitive files
  deny /etc/shadow r,
  deny /etc/ssh/* r,
}
```
## Abstractions in apparmor 

```shell
#include <abstractions/base>
#include <abstractions/mysql>
```
These are called abstractions.
ðŸ‘‰ ***These abstraction files are part of the AppArmor package and are typically located in /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/. You can explore this directory to see the available abstraction files and understand what permissions they include.***

### Examples of abstractions
/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/base typically includes permissions for basic operations, like accessing system libraries, devices, etc.

#### base
```shell
  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/** mr,
  /lib64/** mr,
  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/** mr,
  /usr/lib64/** mr,
  /dev/urandom r,
  ...
```
#### mysql
/etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/mysql includes permissions specific to MySQL, such as accessing MySQL binaries, configuration files, and data directories.

```shell
  /usr/sbin/mysqld mr,
  /etc/mysql/** r,
  /var/lib/mysql/** rwk,
  /var/run/mysqld/** rw,
  ...
```

#### Writing an AppArmor Profile
When writing an AppArmor profile, you include the necessary abstractions based on what your application needs. Here's a corrected example using the abstractions:

```shell
#include <tunables/global>

profile mysql-profile flags=(attach_disconnected) {
  #include <abstractions/base>
  #include <abstractions/mysql>

  # Allow read/write access to database files
  /var/lib/mysql/ r,
  /var/lib/mysql/** rwk,

  # Deny access to all other file systems
  deny /home/** rw,
  deny /media/** rw,
  deny /mnt/** rw,
  deny /tmp/** rw,
}
```

## Load the AppArmor profile called custom-nginx on control plane node and make sure that it is in enforced mode.The profile file is called usr.sbin.nginx located in the default AppArmor profiles directory.

### Solution:
To load an AppArmor profile and set it to enforced mode, you can use the apparmor_parser and aa-enforce commands. Here are the steps to load the AppArmor profile named custom-nginx from the file usr.sbin.nginx:

#### 1. Navigate to the AppArmor Profiles Directory:

Go to the default AppArmor profiles directory, which is usually located at /etc/apparmor.d/.

    cd /etc/apparmor.d/

#### 2.Load the AppArmor Profile:

Use the apparmor_parser command to load the AppArmor profile from the specified file.

    sudo apparmor_parser -r -W usr.sbin.nginx

The -r flag reloads the profile, and the -W flag enables warnings.

#### 3.Verify the Loaded Profile:

Verify that the custom-nginx profile has been loaded.
      
      sudo apparmor_status
Look for the custom-nginx profile in the list of enforced profiles.

#### 4.Set the Profile to Enforced Mode:

Use the aa-enforce command to set the profile to enforced mode.

    sudo aa-enforce usr.sbin.nginx
This command enforces the specified profile, ensuring that processes running under the profile are restricted by AppArmor rules.
Verify Enforced Mode:

#### 5.Verify that the profile is in enforced mode.

    sudo aa-status

Look for the custom-nginx profile in the list, and ensure that it is in enforced mode.

This sequence of commands assumes that the AppArmor profile file usr.sbin.nginx is correctly located in the /etc/apparmor.d/ directory. Please replace paths accordingly if your system has a different configuration.

#### How do you audit and monitor AppArmor policies?

Use log files (typically /var/log/syslog or /var/log/kern.log) and tools like ausearch and auditd to monitor and audit AppArmor policy enforcement.


## Some Tricky Questions to revise
### What happens if an AppArmor profile becomes corrupted or improperly configured? How would you restore or fix it?

Answer: If a profile is corrupted, it may prevent the application from functioning properly. To restore or fix it:

- Use aa-status to check the current profile status.
- Edit or replace the corrupted profile with a correct version from /etc/apparmor.d/.
- Reload the profile using apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.example to apply the changes.

### What are "AppArmor abstractions," and how can they simplify the writing of profiles?
Answer: AppArmor abstractions are predefined sets of rules that provide a convenient way to write common access controls (e.g., access to networking or shared libraries). Instead of writing rules from scratch, you can include abstractions like:

```shell
#include <abstractions/base>
```
This simplifies profile creation by reusing common access patterns.

### How can you ensure that an application continues to run even if its AppArmor profile denies certain actions?
Answer: You can use the complain mode for the AppArmor profile, which will log violations but not enforce them. This allows the application to continue running while you monitor the logs to identify the necessary changes for the profile. You can also fine-tune the profile to allow specific actions based on the application's needs.
