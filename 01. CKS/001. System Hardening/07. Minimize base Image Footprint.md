Instead of using a full-featured base image like ubuntu, consider using a minimal base image such as alpine. Hereâ€™s a sample Dockerfile that uses an Alpine base image:

```Dockerfile
# Use a minimal base image
FROM alpine:latest
# Install only necessary packages
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
# Copy application files
COPY my-app /usr/local/bin/my-app
USER myuser
# Set the entrypoint for the container
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/my-app"]
```

Minimizing the footprint of your base images is one of the most effective ways to reduce the attack surface of your containers. 
Smaller images have fewer components and, therefore, fewer vulnerabilities.
