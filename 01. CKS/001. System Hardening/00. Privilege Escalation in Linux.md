## Privilege Escalation in Linux

The configuration file is typically located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config on Linux systems. Follow these steps to disable direct root login:

Open the SSH daemon configuration file in a text editor. You might need administrative privileges to edit this file, so use sudo or su:

      sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Look for the line that starts with PermitRootLogin. By default, it might look like this:

Change the value from yes to no:

      PermitRootLogin no

This change disallows direct root login.

Save the file and exit the text editor.
Restart the SSH service to apply the changes:

      sudo systemctl restart sshd
