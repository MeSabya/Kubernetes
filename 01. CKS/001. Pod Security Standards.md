Kubernetes v1.22 provides an alpha release for the successor of Pod Security Policy (PSP) (which is scheduled for deprecation in v1.25).
Successor of PSP are : PSS and PSA .

- Pod Security Standards
- Pod Security Admission

## Pod Security Standards

### Usage:
Pod Security Standards define different levels of security configurations that Pods must follow in a Kubernetes cluster. They specify the restrictions and best practices for Pod configurations to enhance security.

### Pod Security Standards Levels:
Kubernetes defines three levels of security for Pods:

#### 1. Privileged Policy
- Description:

The most permissive policy.
Suitable for trusted workloads where security restrictions aren't a concern (e.g., debugging tools, administrative workloads).
- Allowed:
Everything. No restrictions on Pod configurations.
Privileged containers, host networking, host paths, and privilege escalation are all allowed.

- Prohibited:
  Nothing is blocked or restricted.
#### 2. Baseline Policy
- Description:
A moderately restrictive policy suitable for general-purpose workloads.
Designed to prevent known privilege escalation risks but still allows common usage patterns.

- Allowed:
  
      Privilege Escalation: Not allowed (allowPrivilegeEscalation: false is required).
      Capabilities: Default Linux capabilities are allowed (but no added capabilities like NET_ADMIN, SYS_ADMIN).
      Host Networking and Namespaces:
      hostNetwork, hostPID, and hostIPC: Not allowed.
      Volume Types:
      Allows most volume types, except hostPath, awsElasticBlockStore, and a few others.
      SELinux: Workloads can use SELinux labels but are not required to.
      RunAsUser: Running as any user is allowed (including root), but privilege escalation is blocked.
      Prohibited:
      Privileged containers (privileged: true).
      Host namespaces (hostPID, hostIPC, hostNetwork).
      HostPath volumes or other high-risk volume types.
      Allowing privilege escalation (allowPrivilegeEscalation: true).

#### 3. Restricted Policy
- Description:
The most restrictive policy, suitable for highly sensitive workloads.
Enforces stricter security standards to align with industry best practices and compliance requirements.

- Allowed:

        Capabilities: Only default Linux capabilities are allowed (no additional capabilities can be added).
        Volumes:
        Only safe volume types are allowed:
        ConfigMap, Secret, DownwardAPI, EmptyDir, PersistentVolumeClaim, Projected, etc.
        RunAsUser:
        Must explicitly configure non-root user (runAsNonRoot: true and runAsUser).
        Seccomp:
        Must explicitly use RuntimeDefault or Localhost profiles.
        SELinux: Labels are allowed but must be explicitly defined.
        Networking: Only Pod-level network namespaces are allowed.
        Prohibited:
        Privileged containers (privileged: true).
        Adding capabilities (capabilities.add in the securityContext).
        Host networking and namespaces (hostPID, hostIPC, hostNetwork).
        Allowing privilege escalation (allowPrivilegeEscalation: true).
        Unsafe volume types:
        hostPath, nfs, awsElasticBlockStore, cephFS, and similar volumes.

## Pod Security Admission
FEATURE STATE: Kubernetes v1.25 [stable]

Pod Security Admission is the mechanism used to enforce the Pod Security Standards (PSS) in a Kubernetes cluster. It is a built-in admission controller that validates Pod specifications against the configured PSS level (Privileged, Baseline, or Restricted).

### How PSA Works:

#### Namespace-Level Enforcement:
The security level (Privileged, Baseline, or Restricted) is applied to namespaces. For example:

- Namespace dev could have the Baseline level.
- Namespace prod could have the Restricted level.

#### Modes:
PSA operates in three enforcement modes:

- Enforce: Reject Pods that violate the security policy.
- Audit: Log violations but still allow the Pod to run.
- Warn: Send warnings to users about violations during kubectl operations.

### When to Use PSS and PSA:
- Use PSS as a guideline to define your security requirements.
- Enable PSA to enforce those requirements automatically, ensuring that all namespaces comply with your security policies.

### Real-Time Use Cases Solved by PSS

#### Multi-Tenant Clusters:

- Scenario: A Kubernetes cluster is shared between multiple teams or tenants, each deploying their own workloads.
- Problem: Some tenants might deploy Pods with permissive configurations (e.g., host networking, privileged containers), which could compromise cluster security.
- PSS Solution: Enforce the Baseline or Restricted profile on tenant namespaces to ensure that no risky configurations are allowed.

#### DevOps Pipelines and CI/CD:

- Scenario: Automated pipelines deploy applications to Kubernetes without human intervention.
- Problem: Developers might accidentally include insecure Pod specifications in their manifests (e.g., using runAsRoot: true).
- PSS Solution: PSA enforces PSS at admission, blocking insecure configurations from entering the cluster.

#### Compliance-Driven Environments:

- Scenario: An organization must adhere to strict compliance standards like SOC2 or ISO 27001.
- Problem: Ensuring every team configures security policies correctly across hundreds of workloads is nearly impossible.
- PSS Solution: PSS automates enforcement of compliance policies across the entire cluster.

#### Security for Third-Party/Untrusted Workloads:

Scenario: A team integrates third-party services or workloads from untrusted sources (e.g., Helm charts from public repositories).
Problem: These workloads might have insecure configurations that introduce vulnerabilities.
PSS Solution: The Restricted profile ensures third-party workloads meet strict security requirements before being deployed.

#### Cluster-Wide Migration to Higher Security:
- Scenario: An organization starts with permissive configurations for development purposes and needs to gradually adopt stricter security policies in production.
- Problem: Moving to stricter policies requires careful planning and enforcement without disrupting existing workloads.
- PSS Solution: Gradual enforcement via audit and warn modes allows admins to test policies before full enforcement.
