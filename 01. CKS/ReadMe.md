## Cluster Setup and Hardening
   1. Authentication
   2. Authorization
   3. Service Accounts
   4. TLS in K8s
   5. Protect node metadata and endpoint
   6. Securing k8s dashboard
   7. Verifying platform binaries
   8. Upgrade kubernetes frequently
   9. Network policies
   10. Securing ingress

## System Hardening

## Supply Chain security 
   1. Minimize base image foorprint
   2. Image security
   3. Secure your supply chain
   4. use static analysis of workloads
   5. scan images for known vulenrabilities

## Monitoring , Logging
  1. Detect Malicious activity
  2. Detect threats
  3. Detect all phases of attacks
  4. Perform deep analytical investigation
  5. Immutability of containers
  6. use audit logs to monitor access
