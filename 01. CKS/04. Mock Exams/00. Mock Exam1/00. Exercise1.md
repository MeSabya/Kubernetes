A pod has been created in the omni namespace. However, there are a couple of issues with it.

The pod has been created with more permissions than it needs.
It allows read access in the directory /usr/share/nginx/html/internal causing an Internal Site to be accessed publicly.

To check this, click on the button called Site (above the terminal) and add /internal/ to the end of the URL.
Use the below recommendations to fix this.

Use the AppArmor profile created at /etc/apparmor.d/frontend to restrict the internal site.
There are several service accounts created in the omni namespace. Apply the principle of least privilege and use the service account with the minimum privileges (excluding the default service account).
Once the pod is recreated with the correct service account, delete the other unused service accounts in omni namespace (excluding the default service account).


You can recreate the pod but do not create a new service accounts and do not use the default service account.
correct service account used?

obsolete service accounts deleted?

internal-site restricted?

pod running?
