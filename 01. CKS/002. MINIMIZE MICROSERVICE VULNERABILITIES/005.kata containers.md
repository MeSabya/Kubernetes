Kata Containers is an open-source container runtime that provides lightweight virtual machines
(VMs) as an alternative to traditional container runtimes. It aims to combine the performance benefits of
containers with the security advantages of virtual machines. 
Kata Containers can be integrated with popular container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes and Docker.

Key features and concepts of Kata Containers include:

### Lightweight VMs:

Kata Containers uses lightweight virtual machines as the isolation boundary for containerized applications. 
Each container runs in its own VM, providing strong isolation between containers.

### KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine):

Kata Containers leverages KVM technology to create and manage lightweight VMs. KVM is a Linux kernel module that turns the host
operating system into a hypervisor, allowing multiple VMs to run on a single host.

### Secure Isolation:

The use of VMs provides a higher level of security isolation compared to traditional container runtimes. 
Each container operates in its own VM with its own kernel, file system, and network stack.
