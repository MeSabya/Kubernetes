## Enable and configure encryption of secret data at rest
First let's see how secrets work in Kubernetes.

- Secrets are used to store sensitive information, like passwords or keys.
- They’re similar to ConfigMaps, except that they’re stored in an **encoded format not in encrypted format**

### Let's see how we can decode the secret data with an example,

#### 1. First encode the secret value and then create a secret called my-secret as below,

#### 2. Using the etcdctl command line, read that Secret out of etcd:
   command to read secret from etcd:

   **Output:**
   ![image](https://github.com/MeSabya/Kubernetes/assets/33947539/6ea4e3ba-8d89-4d64-b40d-3f420cccf0f8)

    Check the data marked with red color in output, the secret data is stored in plain text format.
#### 3. Now get the secret value and decode it using base64 with — decode option,

**Now put all together and observe the secret data, we are clearly able to decode the secret data and which is not good for sensitive data.**

#### 4. How to check if encryption-provider-config is set in kube-apiserver pod configuration

Check if the **encryption-provider-config** flag is set in the kube-apiserver pod configuration, 
you'll need to inspect the configuration of the kube-apiserver process in the running pod. 

```bash
kubectl exec -it -n kube-system <pod-name> -- sh

cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```
#### 5. What is the EncryptionConfiguration object when it is needed?
The EncryptionConfiguration is used to specify encryption-related settings for the etcd data at rest.
Here's a simplified example of how it might look in a Kubernetes configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta2
kind: EncryptionConfiguration
resources:
  - resources:
    - secrets
    providers:
    - aescbc:
        keys:
        - name: key1
          secret: <base64-encoded-secret-key1>
        - name: key2
          secret: <base64-encoded-secret-key2>
```
In this corrected example, the kind is EncryptionConfiguration. 
It specifies the resources to be encrypted (in this case, secrets) and the encryption provider (aescbc), along with the encryption keys.

Provider can be one of the followings:

#### 6. How to use the above config object
- Generate a 32-byte random key and base64 encode it. If you’re on Linux or macOS, run the following command:
   ![image](https://github.com/MeSabya/Kubernetes/assets/33947539/11045c5f-3369-44c8-97d9-75f6d92d2864)

- Place that value in the secret field of the EncryptionConfiguration struct. Now the EncryptionConfiguration object looks as below,
  ![image](https://github.com/MeSabya/Kubernetes/assets/33947539/fdd9c89b-efe0-4c40-ac23-5622422f0879)

- Set the --encryption-provider-config flag on the kube-apiserver to point to the location of the config file.

You will need to mount the new encryption config file to the kube-apiserver static pod.

Create a enc under /etc/kubernetes/ folder and save the new encryption config file to /etc/kubernetes/enc/encryptionConfig.yaml on the control-plane node.
Edit the manifest for the kube-apiserver static pod: /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml similarly to this:

![image](https://github.com/MeSabya/Kubernetes/assets/33947539/162ae07a-4edd-4625-bfc8-28bbacd6e9b6)

#### Restart the kube api server pod.
