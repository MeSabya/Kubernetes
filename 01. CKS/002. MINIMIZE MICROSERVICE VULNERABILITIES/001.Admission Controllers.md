##  Admission controllers

Admission controllers are plugins that intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server before the persistence of the object, 
allowing you to enforce policies and make changes to the objects being created or modified

Admission controllers play a pivotal role in the Kubernetes API serverâ€™s lifecycle, enhancing security and control while adapting requests for seamless integration.

### Types of Admission Controllers 
Two common types of admission controllers are mutating admission controllers and validating admission controllers, and they serve different purposes:

#### Mutating Admission Controllers:

Purpose: Mutating admission controllers modify the incoming object (e.g., Pod, Service) before it is persisted in the cluster.

**Use Cases:**

- Automatically injecting sidecar containers.
- Setting default values for certain fields.
- Enforcing naming conventions.
- Adding annotations or labels to objects.

Example:

Injecting environment variables or volume mounts into Pods.

##### How it Works:

The controller intercepts the admission request.
Modifies the object (e.g., adds, removes, or modifies fields).
The modified object is then stored in the cluster.

#### Validating Admission Controllers:

Purpose: Validating admission controllers validate the incoming object and decide whether to accept or reject the request based on predefined policies.

**Use Cases:**

- Enforcing security policies.
- Validating resource limits.
- Checking naming conventions.
- Custom business logic validations.

Example:

Ensuring that Pods are not requesting excessive resources.

##### How it Works:

- The controller intercepts the admission request.
- Validates the object against predefined policies.
- Decides to accept or reject the request based on the validation results.
- If rejected, the object is not persisted in the cluster.

#### Some more use cases are:
1. Only Permit images from certain registry.
2. Dont permit runAs root user.
3. Only permit certain capabilities.
4. Pod should always have labels.

### Commands related to admission controllers 

#### View Enabled admission controllers

    kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins

    or 

    kubectl exec kube-apiserver-controlplane -n kubesystem -- kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins

#### Enable Admission controller 
![image](https://github.com/MeSabya/Kubernetes/assets/33947539/529cd57b-ff07-447c-ba08-b884d539e82a)

Restart the kubelet to apply the changes:

      sudo systemctl restart kubelet

Note: Restarting the kubelet will cause the kube-apiserver to restart with the updated configuration.
Verify that the admission controllers are enabled by checking the kube-apiserver logs:

      sudo journalctl -u kube-apiserver -n 100

## Quiz
### Problem:1
We are trying to create a POD in blue namespace using the command below:
        kubectl run nginx --image nginx -n blue

It is failing with error blue namespace does not exist. because Kubernetes has **NamespaceExists admission controller** enabled which rejects requests to namespaces that do not exist. So, to create a namespace that does not exist automatically, we could enable the **NamespaceAutoProvision admission controller**

#### How to enable the NamespaceAutoProvision admission controller
Follow the above procedure to Enable the Admission controller

Note that the NamespaceExists and NamespaceAutoProvision admission controllers are deprecated and now replaced by NamespaceLifecycle admission controller.

The NamespaceLifecycle admission controller will make sure that requests
to a non-existent namespace is rejected and that the default namespaces such as
default, kube-system and kube-public cannot be deleted.

#### How to see enabled and disabled plugins in kube-apiserver

Since the kube-apiserver is running as pod you can check the process to see enabled and disabled plugins.

        ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver | grep admission-plugins
