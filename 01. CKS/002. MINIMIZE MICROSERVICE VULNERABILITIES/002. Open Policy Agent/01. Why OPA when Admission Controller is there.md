## Why use OPA when we have Admission controller in K8s

So Lets discuss:

1. Admission controllers can be configured to operate at the namespace level, making them well-suited for policies that should be applied within a specific namespace.
   So OPA can be used to Enforcing consistent policies across namespaces , across multiple Kubernetes clusters or even across different platforms.

2.  Policies that span multiple resources (e.g., Pod, ConfigMap, Secret) and involve relationships between them.
    Reason: OPA allows you to define policies that consider relationships and interactions between different types of resources,
    offering more flexibility than individual admission controllers.

3. Example: Creating a custom policy framework that extends beyond the capabilities of built-in admission controllers.
   Reason: OPA is a general-purpose policy engine that can be used in various systems, providing a more extensible framework for policy enforcement.
