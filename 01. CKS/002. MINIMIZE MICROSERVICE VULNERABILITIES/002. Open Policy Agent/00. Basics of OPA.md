## Real-world Examples 

Here are a few real-world examples of how Open Policy Agent (OPA) is used in different contexts:

### Kubernetes Admission Control:

Scenario: An organization wants to enforce specific security policies for all Kubernetes resources deployed in their clusters.
OPA Use: OPA can be integrated with Kubernetes admission controllers to enforce policies like requiring specific labels, denying containers with certain images, or enforcing naming conventions.

### API Authorization:

Scenario: A company has multiple microservices exposing APIs, and they want to control access based on fine-grained policies.
OPA Use: OPA can be used to define and enforce authorization policies for API endpoints. For example, it can ensure that only users with certain roles or permissions are allowed to access specific API routes.

### Microservices Authorization:

Scenario: In a microservices architecture, services need to communicate with each other securely.
OPA Use: OPA can enforce policies on which services are allowed to communicate with each other. This could include policies based on service identity, network segmentation, or data validation.

### Cloud Security Policies:

Scenario: An organization wants to ensure that resources deployed in a cloud environment adhere to specific security and compliance standards.
OPA Use: OPA can be used to define and enforce security policies for cloud resources. For instance, it can ensure that only approved virtual machine images are used, or that storage buckets have the correct access controls.

### Data Filtering and Validation:

Scenario: An application processes data from various sources, and the organization wants to filter and validate the incoming data based on specific criteria.
OPA Use: OPA can be used to define policies for filtering and validating incoming data. This could include ensuring that certain fields are present, data formats are correct, or that sensitive information is redacted.

### GitOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Scenario: An organization follows GitOps practices and wants to ensure that changes to infrastructure code comply with certain standards.
OPA Use: OPA can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to check and enforce policies on infrastructure code changes. For example, it can verify that all resources have defined 
ownership labels or that specific naming conventions are followed.

## Seems like its a mix of RBAC and admission controller ..how it is different from both of them ?

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):

- Scope: RBAC is primarily concerned with defining roles, permissions, and access controls within an application or system.

- Granularity: RBAC typically focuses on controlling access at a coarse level, defining roles and associating them with certain permissions.

- Use Case: RBAC is commonly used to manage user access within an application, specifying who can perform certain actions based on their assigned roles.

### Admission Controllers:

- Scope: Admission controllers operate within Kubernetes and are specifically designed to intercept and control requests to the API server before they are persisted. 
They are often used to ensure that resources adhere to certain policies before being allowed into the cluster.

- Granularity: Admission controllers are more focused on the Kubernetes resource level, enforcing policies related to the creation and modification of resources 
such as pods, services, and deployments.

- Use Case: Admission controllers are commonly used in Kubernetes to enforce security policies, resource constraints, and other operational requirements.

### Open Policy Agent (OPA):

- Scope: OPA is a more general-purpose policy engine that can be used across different layers of the stack, including Kubernetes, microservices, APIs, and more.
  
- Granularity: OPA provides fine-grained control and is not limited to access control or resource-level policies. It allows you to define and enforce policies at various levels, such as data filtering, API authorization, network policies, and more.

- Use Case: OPA is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of use cases, making it suitable for scenarios beyond access control and admission control. It allows you to express and enforce policies in a declarative manner across different types of systems.

## Example of simple Python application with and without using OPA.

### Simple Python Application (Without OPA):
```python
# Simple user authentication in Python without OPA

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, password, role):
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        self.role = role

class AuthService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = [
            User("alice", "pass123", "admin"),
            User("bob", "pass456", "user"),
        ]

    def authenticate(self, username, password):
        for user in self.users:
            if user.username == username and user.password == password:
                return user
        return None

# Example usage
auth_service = AuthService()

# Attempt to authenticate a user
authenticated_user = auth_service.authenticate("alice", "pass123")

if authenticated_user:
    print(f"User '{authenticated_user.username}' authenticated with role '{authenticated_user.role}'")
else:
    print("Authentication failed")
```

### Python Application with OPA:

Create an OPA policy file named user_roles.rego:

```rego
package main

default allow = false

allow {
    input.method == "GET"
    input.path = ["public", ...]
}

allow {
    input.method == "GET"
    input.path = ["private", ...]
    user = get_user()
    user.role == "admin"
}

get_user() = user {
    user = {
        "username": input.user,
        "role": data.users[input.user].role,
    }
}
```

```python
from pyopa import Client

class User:
    # (unchanged)

class AuthService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {
            "alice": User("alice", "pass123", "admin"),
            "bob": User("bob", "pass456", "user"),
        }
        self.opa_client = Client()

    def authenticate(self, username, password):
        # (unchanged)

    def check_access(self, user, path, method="GET"):
        input_data = {"user": user.username, "path": path, "method": method}
        result = self.opa_client.eval_query("main.allow", input_data)
        return result["result"]

# Example usage
auth_service = AuthService()

# Authenticate a user
authenticated_user = auth_service.authenticate("alice", "pass123")

if authenticated_user:
    print(f"User '{authenticated_user.username}' authenticated with role '{authenticated_user.role}'")

    # Check access to a private path
    if auth_service.check_access(authenticated_user, ["private", "resource"], method="GET"):
        print("Access granted to private resource.")
    else:
        print("Access denied to private resource.")
else:
    print("Authentication failed")
```

## Default PORT for OPA
The default gRPC port for the Open Policy Agent (OPA) server is 8181. When you run the OPA server, 
it typically binds to this port to expose the gRPC API, allowing clients to interact with OPA.

Here's an example of starting the OPA server and specifying the gRPC port:

```bash
opa run --server --addr :8181
```
