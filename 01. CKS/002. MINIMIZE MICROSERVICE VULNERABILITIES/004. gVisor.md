gVisor enhances the isolation of containers by introducing an additional layer, known as the "sandbox," 
which runs in user space. This user-space kernel provided by gVisor intercepts and handles system calls made by the containerized application. 
This architecture offers several advantages and enhancements to the isolation of containers:

### User-Space Kernel:
Containers in gVisor run with their own user-space kernel, distinct from the host kernel. This separation allows gVisor to control and manage the system calls made by containerized applications without relying directly on the host kernel. It effectively acts as a user-space kernel emulator.

### Reduced Attack Surface:
By intercepting system calls in user space, gVisor reduces the attack surface exposed to the containerized application. Even if there are vulnerabilities or exploits in the application, the impact is limited to the gVisor sandbox, preventing direct manipulation of the host kernel.

### Security by Default:
gVisor enforces security best practices by default. Containers run with a reduced set of Linux capabilities, limiting the actions they can perform. This "secure by default" approach minimizes the risk of unintended actions and potential security vulnerabilities.

### Compatibility Across Kernels:
Since gVisor runs in user space and emulates a subset of the Linux kernel, it can provide a consistent runtime environment across different host kernels and operating systems. This enhances compatibility and allows containers to run in heterogeneous environments.

### Resource Limits and Controls:
gVisor allows administrators to set resource limits for containers, controlling their CPU, memory, and other resource usage. This provides fine-grained control over the resources allocated to each container.

### Isolation for File System and Processes:
gVisor provides process-level isolation for containers. Each container runs in its own isolated environment, and file system interactions are mediated by the gVisor kernel. 
This isolation prevents containers from interfering with each other's processes and file systems.

### Dynamic Sandboxes:
gVisor can create dynamic sandboxes for each container, isolating them from each other. This dynamic creation of
sandboxes allows for efficient resource utilization and isolation of containers, particularly in multi-tenant environments.

## Summary
To summarize gVisor is needed to isolate containers from linux kernel and also to isolate containers from containers.
