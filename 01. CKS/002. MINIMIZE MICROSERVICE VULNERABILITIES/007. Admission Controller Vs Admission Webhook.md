## Admission controllers
Admission controllers in Kubernetes are plugins that intercept requests to the Kubernetes API server before persistence of the object, 
but after the request is authenticated and authorized. They can be used to enforce custom policies and modify objects before they are persisted.

### Rigidity of Admission Controller
With admission controllers compiled into the kube-apiserver, any changes to the admission control logic require recompilation and restart of the kube-apiserver, 
which can be a cumbersome and disruptive process.
**Admission webhooks address this limitation.**

### Running the Admission Controller:

ðŸ‘‰ 1. Setup Your Environment:

Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
Install any necessary dependencies.
Compile the Controller:

Save the provided code in a file (e.g., admission-controller.go).

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.

Run the following command to build the binary:

bash
Copy code
go build admission-controller.go

ðŸ‘‰ 2.Deploy the Admission Controller:

Deploy the admission controller binary to a location accessible to the kube-apiserver.

Update the kube-apiserver configuration to include the admission controller. Add the following configuration to the kube-apiserver flags:

```bash
--admission-control=...,[admission_controller_name]
--admission-control-config-file=/path/to/admission-controller-config.yaml
Replace [admission_controller_name] with the name of your admission controller and provide the path to a configuration file if needed.
```

Example admission-controller-config.yaml:

```yaml
kind: AdmissionConfiguration
plugins:
- name: [admission_controller_name]
  path: /path/to/admission-controller-binary
```
Ensure that your admission controller is reachable by the kube-apiserver.

ðŸ‘‰ 3. Restart the kube-apiserver:

Restart the kube-apiserver to apply the changes.

## Admission webhooks
- Admission webhooks were introduced to address this rigidity and provide a more flexible and dynamic way to implement admission control.
- Admission webhooks allow external services to be called during the admission process, enabling custom validation and mutation of
  admission requests.
- This external service can be hosted outside the Kubernetes cluster, providing greater flexibility in implementing and updating 
  admission control logic without modifying the Kubernetes configuration.

### Running the Admission Webhook:
ðŸ‘‰ 1. Setup Your Environment:

Ensure you have Go installed on your machine.
Install any necessary dependencies.
Create SSL certificates (e.g., server.crt and server.key) for secure communication. In a production environment, consider obtaining valid certificates.

Compile the Webhook:

Save the provided code in a file (e.g., admission-webhook.go).

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.

Run the following command to build the binary:

```bash
go build admission-webhook.go
```

ðŸ‘‰ 2. Deploy the Admission Webhook:

Deploy the admission webhook binary to a location accessible to the webhook service.

Create a Kubernetes ValidatingWebhookConfiguration to register your webhook with the Kubernetes API server. Specify the URL where the webhook is reachable.

```bash
kubectl apply -f webhook-config.yaml
```

Example webhook-config.yaml:

```yaml
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: example-webhook
webhooks:
  - name: webhook.example.com
    clientConfig:
      service:
        name: example-webhook
        namespace: default
        path: "/validate"
        port: 443
      caBundle: <YOUR_CA_BUNDLE>
    rules:
      ...
```

Ensure that your admission webhook is reachable by the kube-apiserver.

Start the Admission Webhook:

Run the admission webhook binary. In a production environment, you would typically deploy the webhook service using a web server like Nginx or Apache with proper TLS termination.

```bash
./admission-webhook
```

Verify Webhook Service Health:

Ensure that the webhook service is running and reachable.
Deploy Resources to Trigger Webhook:

Deploy Kubernetes resources (e.g., Pods) that will trigger the admission webhook calls.
