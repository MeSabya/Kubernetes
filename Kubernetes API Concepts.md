# Kubernetes API Concepts

The Kubernetes API is a resource-based (RESTful) programmatic interface provided via HTTP. It supports retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting primary resources via the standard HTTP verbs (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, GET).

ðŸ‘‰ Kubernetes supports efficient change notifications on resources via watches. 

ðŸ‘‰ Kubernetes also provides consistent list operations so that API clients can effectively cache, track, and synchronize the state of resources.

## Kubernetes API terminology

Kubernetes generally leverages common RESTful terminology to describe the API concepts:

- A resource type is the name used in the URL (pods, namespaces, services)
- All resource types have a concrete representation (their object schema) which is called a kind
- A list of instances of a resource is known as a collection
- A single instance of a resource type is called a resource, and also usually represents an object
- For some resource types, the API includes one or more sub-resources, which are represented as URI paths below the resource

## Resource URIs

You can also access collections of resources (for example: listing all Nodes). The following paths are used to retrieve collections and resources:

ðŸ‘‰ **Cluster-scoped resources:**

GET /apis/GROUP/VERSION/RESOURCETYPE - return the collection of resources of the resource type
GET /apis/GROUP/VERSION/RESOURCETYPE/NAME - return the resource with NAME under the resource type

ðŸ‘‰ **Namespace-scoped resources:**

GET /apis/GROUP/VERSION/RESOURCETYPE - return the collection of all instances of the resource type across all namespaces
GET /apis/GROUP/VERSION/namespaces/NAMESPACE/RESOURCETYPE - return collection of all instances of the resource type in NAMESPACE
GET /apis/GROUP/VERSION/namespaces/NAMESPACE/RESOURCETYPE/NAME - return the instance of the resource type with NAME in NAMESPACE

## Efficient detection of changes
The Kubernetes API allows clients to make an initial request for an object or a collection, and then to track changes since that initial request: a watch. Clients can send a list or a get and then make a follow-up watch request.
