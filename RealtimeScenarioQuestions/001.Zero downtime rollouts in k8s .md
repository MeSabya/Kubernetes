## Steps to Achieve Zero Downtime Rollouts

### 1. Using Rolling Updates in Deployments
A Deployment is the standard method for rolling updates in Kubernetes. When a new version of your application is deployed, the old Pods are replaced incrementally with new Pods, maintaining availability throughout the process.

#### Key Parameters:

- maxUnavailable: The maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during the update. For zero downtime, set this to 0.
- maxSurge: The maximum number of extra Pods that can be created during the update. This allows new Pods to be created before the old ones are terminated.

Example Deployment YAML for Rolling Update:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxUnavailable: 0        # Ensure no downtime
      maxSurge: 1              # Create 1 new Pod at a time
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        image: my-app:v2       # New version
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        readinessProbe:        # Ensures Pod is ready before receiving traffic
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:         # Restarts unhealthy Pods
          httpGet:
            path: /healthz
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          periodSeconds: 5
```
#### Zero Downtime Configuration:
- maxUnavailable: 0 ensures that no Pods will be unavailable during the update.
- maxSurge: 1 ensures that only one additional Pod is added at a time during the update process.
- Readiness probe ensures that traffic is not sent to a new Pod until it is fully ready to handle requests.

### 2. Using Readiness and Liveness Probes
These probes ensure that Pods are healthy and ready before they start handling traffic:

- Readiness Probe: Ensures that Kubernetes routes traffic only to healthy Pods that are ready to serve.
- Liveness Probe: Detects when a running Pod is in an unhealthy state and restarts it automatically.

Proper configuration of these probes is crucial for achieving zero downtime since they prevent the new version from receiving traffic until it is fully operational.

### 3. Blue-Green Deployments
In some cases, a blue-green deployment strategy is used to ensure zero downtime. In this strategy:

- Blue environment: The current version of the application.
- Green environment: The new version of the application.

Steps:

- Deploy the new version (green environment) alongside the existing version (blue environment).
- Once the green environment is fully tested and verified, switch all traffic to the green environment by updating the Service to point to the new Pods.
- Once traffic is switched, the blue environment (old version) can be safely removed.

### 4. Canary Deployments
In a canary deployment, a small portion of the traffic is routed to the new version of the application, allowing it to be tested under real-world conditions before rolling it out to the entire user base. If the canary deployment succeeds, you gradually increase the traffic to the new version.

Steps:

- Deploy the new version alongside the old one.
- Route a small percentage of traffic to the new version.
- Gradually increase traffic to the new version while monitoring its performance.
- Once the new version is stable, scale down the old version.
- You can use tools like Istio or Linkerd for traffic splitting and monitoring in canary deployments.

### 5. Pod disruption budget
PDB is designed to ensure a minimum level of availability of Pods during voluntary disruptions (such as draining a node, rolling updates, etc.). It prevents too many Pods from being taken down simultaneously by setting constraints on how many Pods can be disrupted at any given time.

***Key Use Case: PDB is primarily used during operations like node maintenance, cluster scaling, or upgrades, where Pods could be voluntarily evicted. PDB ensures that a certain number of Pods remain available to serve traffic.***

Configuration:

You can specify either minAvailable or maxUnavailable:

- minAvailable: The minimum number of Pods that must be available at all times.
- maxUnavailable: The maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable at any point in time.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-app-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

In this case, at least 3 Pods must always be available. If the cluster tries to evict Pods during a voluntary disruption (e.g., node maintenance), the operation will be blocked until at least 3 Pods are running.

When to Use: PDB is useful for ensuring high availability, especially for stateful applications like databases or services that can't tolerate multiple Pods going down at once.

### Additional Tips for Zero Downtime
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): To handle traffic spikes during a rolling update, use HPA to automatically scale Pods based on CPU or memory usage.
- Service Meshes (e.g., Istio): These allow for advanced traffic management (e.g., traffic splitting, retries, and circuit breaking) during rolling updates.
- Proper Resource Requests/Limits: Set appropriate CPU and memory requests/limits to avoid overloading the nodes during an update.
