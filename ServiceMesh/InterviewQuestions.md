In Kubernetes, the status field in custom resources like VirtualService and DestinationRule (defined by Istio) provides important information 
about the current state or health of those resources.

### How to View the Status Field
You can check the status of these resources using kubectl or istioctl commands:

```bash
kubectl get virtualservice <name> -o yaml
kubectl get destinationrule <name> -o yaml
```
ðŸ‘‰ **Look for the status field in the output.**

Example:

- VirtualService Status

```yaml
status:
  validation:
    status: Invalid
    message: 'Referenced host "service.default.svc.cluster.local" does not exist'
```
- DestinationRule Status

```yaml
status:
  validation:
    status: Valid
    message: "Resource is correctly configured"
```

### Key Takeaways
- The status field is crucial for understanding the health and correctness of your Istio configurations.
- While not mandatory, many Istio controllers populate it to provide user-friendly feedback.
Regularly reviewing the status field can help prevent issues in the service mesh and ensure smooth operations.
