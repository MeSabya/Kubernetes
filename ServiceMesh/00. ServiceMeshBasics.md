These are the most common features offered from a service mesh.

- Resiliency for inter-service communications: Circuit-breaking, retries and timeouts, fault injection, fault handling, load balancing and failover.
- Service Discovery: Discovery of service endpoints through a dedicated service registry.
- Routing: Primitive routing capabilities, but no routing logics related to the business functionality of the service.
- Observability: Metrics, monitoring, distributed logging, distributed tracing.
- Security: Transport level security (TLS) and key management.
- Access Control: Simple blacklist and whitelist based access control.
- Deployment: Native support for containers. Docker and Kubernetes.
- Interservice communication protocols: HTTP1.x, HTTP2, gRPC

## Architecture
An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.

The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars. 
These proxies mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They also collect and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.

The control plane manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.

The following diagram shows the different components that make up each plane:

### Envoy
Istio uses an extended version of the Envoy proxy. Envoy is a high-performance proxy developed in C++ to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy proxies are the only Istio components that interact with data plane traffic.

Envoy proxies are deployed as sidecars to services, logically augmenting the services with Envoyâ€™s many built-in features, for example:

- Dynamic service discovery
- Load balancing
- TLS termination
- HTTP/2 and gRPC proxies
- Circuit breakers
- Health checks
- Staged rollouts with %-based traffic split
- Fault injection
- Rich metrics

This sidecar deployment allows Istio to enforce policy decisions and extract rich telemetry which can be sent to monitoring systems to provide information about the behavior of the entire mesh.

The sidecar proxy model also allows you to add Istio capabilities to an existing deployment without requiring you to rearchitect or rewrite code.

Some of the Istio features and tasks enabled by Envoy proxies include:

#### Traffic control features: 
enforce fine-grained traffic control with rich routing rules for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.

#### Network resiliency features: 
setup retries, failovers, circuit breakers, and fault injection.

#### Security and authentication features: 
enforce security policies and enforce access control and rate limiting defined through the configuration API.

### Istiod
ðŸ‘‰ Istiod provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management.

ðŸ‘‰ Istiod converts high level routing rules that control traffic behavior into Envoy-specific configurations, and propagates them to the sidecars at runtime.

ðŸ‘‰ Istio can support discovery for multiple environments such as Kubernetes or VMs.

ðŸ‘‰ Istiod acts as a Certificate Authority (CA) and generates certificates to allow secure mTLS communication in the data plane.

## Enabling and Disabling Kubernetes Istio Sidecar Injections
This will enable automatic istio-sidecar injections
```shell
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection
```
