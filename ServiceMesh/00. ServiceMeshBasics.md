### Real-Life Analogy
Imagine a city with many neighborhoods (services). To move between neighborhoods:

- Youâ€™d need roads (networking).
- Youâ€™d want traffic lights (control traffic).
- Youâ€™d like security checkpoints (encryption).
- Youâ€™d track traffic jams (monitoring).

ðŸ‘‰ A service mesh is like adding a transportation department to handle all of this for the city, so neighborhoods donâ€™t have to worry about it.

Simillarly When you have many services:

- They need to find each other (service discovery).
- They need secure communication (e.g., encryption).
- You might want to monitor how they're performing (observability).
- Sometimes, you want to control or test traffic between them (e.g., retries, load balancing).

ðŸ‘‰ Without a service mesh: Every service must handle its own retries, security, and monitoring.

ðŸ‘‰ With a service mesh: The mesh manages all this automatically, so developers can focus on the service logic.


These are the most common features offered from a service mesh.

- Resiliency for inter-service communications: Circuit-breaking, retries and timeouts, fault injection, fault handling, load balancing and failover.
- Service Discovery: Discovery of service endpoints through a dedicated service registry.
- Routing: Primitive routing capabilities, but no routing logics related to the business functionality of the service.
- Observability: Metrics, monitoring, distributed logging, distributed tracing.
- Security: Transport level security (TLS) and key management.
- Access Control: Simple blacklist and whitelist based access control.
- Deployment: Native support for containers. Docker and Kubernetes.
- Interservice communication protocols: HTTP1.x, HTTP2, gRPC

## Architecture
An Istio service mesh is logically split into a data plane and a control plane.

The data plane is composed of a set of intelligent proxies (Envoy) deployed as sidecars. 
These proxies mediate and control all network communication between microservices. They also collect and report telemetry on all mesh traffic.

The control plane manages and configures the proxies to route traffic.

The following diagram shows the different components that make up each plane:

### Envoy
Istio uses an extended version of the Envoy proxy. Envoy is a high-performance proxy developed in C++ to mediate all inbound and outbound traffic for all services in the service mesh. Envoy proxies are the only Istio components that interact with data plane traffic.

Envoy proxies are deployed as sidecars to services, logically augmenting the services with Envoyâ€™s many built-in features, for example:

- Dynamic service discovery
- Load balancing
- TLS termination
- HTTP/2 and gRPC proxies
- Circuit breakers
- Health checks
- Staged rollouts with %-based traffic split
- Fault injection
- Rich metrics

This sidecar deployment allows Istio to enforce policy decisions and extract rich telemetry which can be sent to monitoring systems to provide information about the behavior of the entire mesh.

The sidecar proxy model also allows you to add Istio capabilities to an existing deployment without requiring you to rearchitect or rewrite code.

Some of the Istio features and tasks enabled by Envoy proxies include:

#### Traffic control features: 
enforce fine-grained traffic control with rich routing rules for HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, and TCP traffic.

#### Network resiliency features: 
setup retries, failovers, circuit breakers, and fault injection.

#### Security and authentication features: 
enforce security policies and enforce access control and rate limiting defined through the configuration API.

### Istiod
ðŸ‘‰ Istiod provides service discovery, configuration and certificate management.

ðŸ‘‰ Istiod converts high level routing rules that control traffic behavior into Envoy-specific configurations, and propagates them to the sidecars at runtime.

ðŸ‘‰ Istio can support discovery for multiple environments such as Kubernetes or VMs.

ðŸ‘‰ Istiod acts as a Certificate Authority (CA) and generates certificates to allow secure mTLS communication in the data plane.

### Citadelâ€™s Responsibilities After Deprecation (Integrated into Istiod):
Starting with Istio 1.5, Citadelâ€™s functionality has been incorporated into Istiod. This change was made to simplify Istio's control plane by consolidating several different components (Pilot, Citadel, Galley, etc.) into a single control plane component, Istiod.

Istiod now handles all the security tasks that Citadel previously performed, including:

#### Certificate Management:

Istiod now acts as the certificate authority and manages the lifecycle of certificates for service communication in the mesh.
It issues X.509 certificates to services and automatically rotates them.

#### Mutual TLS (mTLS) Management:

Istiod ensures that mutual TLS is enforced for secure communication between services, similar to how Citadel worked.

#### Identity and Authentication:

Istiod continues to provide secure identity and authentication services by issuing certificates tied to service identities, ensuring that only trusted services can communicate.

#### How Citadel (now Istiod) is Linked to Pilot:
- Pilot (now part of Istiod) is responsible for traffic management, including service discovery, configuration distribution, and pushing routing rules to the Envoy sidecar proxies that handle traffic for each service.
- Citadelâ€™s role in mTLS (now handled by Istiod) is closely related to Pilotâ€™s traffic management. When Istio enforces mTLS for communication, Pilot ensures that the configuration for mTLS is pushed to the Envoy proxies 
  so they can handle secure traffic.

### Hereâ€™s how they are linked:

- Issuing Certificates:

Istiod (formerly Citadel) issues certificates to each service in the mesh.

- Configuring mTLS:

Istiod (formerly Pilot) pushes configuration to Envoy sidecars to enforce mTLS between services.
When mTLS is enabled, Istiod ensures that services have the required certificates and that the Envoy proxies are configured to use them for secure communication.

- Service Discovery and Authentication:

Istiod (formerly Pilot) handles service discovery and pushes the necessary routing configuration to Envoy. It works alongside the mTLS certificates issued by Istiod (formerly Citadel) to ensure that only authenticated services can communicate.
