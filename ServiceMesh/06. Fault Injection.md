## Fault injection

Fault injection in Istio is a mechanism for testing the resilience of your microservices by introducing deliberate failures into the system. This is often used in chaos engineering to ensure your applications can handle various failure scenarios gracefully.

### Types of Fault Injection in Istio
Istio supports two primary types of fault injection:

- Delays: Introduces artificial delays to simulate high latency.
- Aborts: Simulates service failures by returning HTTP error codes.

These faults are configured in Istio using VirtualService resources.

Configuration Examples

#### 1. Introducing a Delay
A delay fault can simulate network latency issues:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: myservice
spec:
  hosts:
    - myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
  http:
    - fault:
        delay:
          percentage: 50
          fixedDelay: 5s
      route:
        - destination:
            host: myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
```

#### Explanation:

- 50% of requests are delayed by 5 seconds.
- The rest of the traffic proceeds normally.

#### 2. Simulating a Service Failure
You can simulate a service returning specific HTTP errors:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: myservice
spec:
  hosts:
    - myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
  http:
    - fault:
        abort:
          percentage: 20
          httpStatus: 503
      route:
        - destination:
            host: myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
```
#### Explanation:
- 20% of requests will return a 503 Service Unavailable error.
- The rest of the traffic proceeds normally.

#### 3. Combining Delays and Aborts
You can combine delays and aborts in a single fault injection rule:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: myservice
spec:
  hosts:
    - myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
  http:
    - fault:
        delay:
          percentage: 50
          fixedDelay: 5s
        abort:
          percentage: 10
          httpStatus: 500
      route:
        - destination:
            host: myservice.default.svc.cluster.local
```
#### Explanation:

- 50% of requests are delayed by 5 seconds.
- 10% of requests return a 500 Internal Server Error.
- These percentages are applied independently
