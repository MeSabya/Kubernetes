## Traffic Mirroring in Istio
Traffic mirroring (also known as shadowing) in Istio allows you to duplicate live traffic from one service and send it to another service for observation, analysis, or 
testing without affecting the original request flow. 
This is useful for scenarios like testing new versions of a service (e.g., canary deployments) or gathering data for debugging without impacting live traffic.

### 1. Traffic Mirroring Basics
Purpose: Traffic mirroring duplicates live traffic from a source service and sends it to a target service.

#### Use Cases:
- Testing a new service version in production without affecting real traffic.
- Observing the behavior of a service under production traffic.
- Debugging or profiling new versions of services.

### 2. Setting Up Traffic Mirroring in Istio
You use VirtualService and DestinationRule to configure traffic mirroring. Hereâ€™s an example of how to set it up:

### 3. Example: Mirroring Traffic from v1 to v2
Assume you have a service my-service with two versions: v1 (stable) and v2 (new version you want to test). You want to mirror 50% of the traffic from v1 to v2.

#### Step 1: Create a VirtualService for Traffic Mirroring

In this step, you define the mirroring behavior for my-service. The mirror field allows you to specify the target version (e.g., v2) and the percentage of traffic to mirror.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  hosts:
    - my-service
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: my-service
            subset: v1
          weight: 50
        - destination:
            host: my-service
            subset: v2
          weight: 50
      mirror:
        host: my-service
        subset: v2
      mirrorPercentage: 50
```

Key Points:
- mirror: Specifies the destination to which the mirrored traffic will be sent (in this case, v2).
- mirrorPercentage: Specifies the percentage of the traffic to be mirrored (50% in this case).

#### Step 2: Define DestinationRule for Versioning
You need a DestinationRule to define the subsets for v1 and v2 of my-service. This is necessary for Istio to differentiate between versions.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  host: my-service
  subsets:
    - name: v1
      labels:
        version: v1
    - name: v2
      labels:
        version: v2
```

Key Points:
subsets: Defines the different versions of the my-service. Here, v1 and v2 are the two versions.

#### Step 3: Apply the Configuration
To apply the traffic mirroring setup, use the following kubectl commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f virtualservice.yaml
kubectl apply -f destinationrule.yaml
```

#### Use Cases for Traffic Mirroring
- Canary Testing: Test a new version of a service by mirroring live traffic to it. This allows you to validate how the new version handles real user traffic without affecting the production environment.
- Zero-Downtime Migrations: Gradually shift traffic to a new version while mirroring the requests to monitor and analyze the results in real time.
- Error Detection and Debugging: Debug new versions under live traffic conditions by mirroring requests and tracking metrics or traces without impacting the primary production environment.
