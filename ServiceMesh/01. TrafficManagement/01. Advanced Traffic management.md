## Istio Supports:
- Percentage-based traffic splitting.
- Header-based routing (e.g., specific users or regions).
- A/B testing and dark launches.

## Percentage-based traffic splitting:
This allows you to distribute traffic across different versions of a service based on percentages.

### Example:
Send 80% of traffic to version v1 and 20% to version v2 of a service:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
          weight: 80
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2
          weight: 20
```
ðŸ‘‰ Ensure the corresponding DestinationRule defines subsets v1 and v2:

## Header-Based Routing
Route traffic based on specific HTTP headers, such as user identity or region.

Example:
Send traffic from users with the X-User-Region header set to us-east to version v1 and other traffic to version v2:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - match:
        - headers:
            x-user-region:
              exact: us-east
      route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2
```

## A/B Testing and Dark Launches
A/B testing involves directing a small subset of users to a new feature, while dark launches allow testing new features silently.

Example (A/B Testing):
Route 5% of traffic from users with X-User-Role: beta header to v2, while others go to v1:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - match:
        - headers:
            x-user-role:
              exact: beta
      route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2
          weight: 5
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
          weight: 95
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
```

Example (Dark Launch):
Mirror a percentage of traffic to a new version (v2) without affecting the original user request:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
      mirror:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      mirrorPercentage:
        value: 10
```
These examples demonstrate how Istioâ€™s declarative configuration allows for sophisticated traffic management, facilitating testing, canary deployments, and targeted feature rollouts.

ðŸ‘‰ **These features are possible without Istio, but you lose out on Istio's seamless integration, observability, security, and reduced complexity. 
Without Istio, achieving similar capabilities would require a mix of tools (e.g., NGINX, Envoy, or custom implementations) and more operational overhead.**

## Percentage-Based Traffic Splitting â‰ˆ Canary Deployment

Canary deployments are a deployment strategy where you release a new version of your application to a small subset of users (e.g., 5%, 10%) while the rest continue using the existing version.
This allows you to test the new version in production with minimal risk before gradually rolling it out to everyone.
Istio's Role:

Istio makes canary deployments easy through percentage-based traffic splitting. You can split traffic between the old and new versions based on percentages.

##  Dark Launches â‰ˆ Traffic Mirroring

A dark launch involves deploying a new version of your application (or feature) but not exposing it to end users. Instead, you mirror live traffic to the new version for testing and performance analysis.
The responses from the new version are not sent back to users; they're only logged or used for monitoring.
Istio's Role:

Istio enables dark launches through traffic mirroring. This allows you to duplicate (mirror) traffic from one version to another without affecting the original traffic flow.
