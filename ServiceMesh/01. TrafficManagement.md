### VirtualService: 
A VirtualService in Istio represents a set of routing rules that determine how incoming requests are routed to different services within the mesh. 
It can represent multiple services or endpoints of an application and define how traffic should be directed to those services based on various criteria such as URI path, headers, or request methods.

### DestinationRule: 
On the other hand, a DestinationRule in Istio is specific to a single service or endpoint within the mesh. It defines subsets of instances for that service based 
on labels and allows you to apply traffic policies such as load balancing settings, TLS settings, and circuit breaking specifically to those subsets.

### In summary:
- VirtualService: Defines routing rules for traffic across multiple services or endpoints.
- DestinationRule: Defines subsets and policies for a single service or endpoint.

Together, VirtualServices and DestinationRules provide powerful capabilities for managing traffic routing and policy enforcement within Istio service meshes, 
enabling fine-grained control over how requests are handled and processed within your application architecture.

## Relationship between Virtual service uses k8s service

In Istio, a VirtualService does not directly use Kubernetes Services for service discovery. Instead, Istio relies on its own internal service registry and data plane proxies (such as Envoy) to manage service discovery and routing within the service mesh.

Here's how service discovery works in Istio:

ðŸ‘‰ Envoy Sidecar Proxies: Each pod in the Kubernetes cluster that's part of the Istio service mesh is injected with an Envoy sidecar proxy. This proxy intercepts all incoming and outgoing traffic for the pod.

ðŸ‘‰ Service Registry: Istio maintains its own service registry, which is populated based on the Kubernetes Services, Endpoints, and other resources in the cluster. Istio's service registry is independent of Kubernetes and is managed by Istio's control plane components.

ðŸ‘‰ Service Mesh Control Plane: Istio's control plane components, such as Pilot and Citadel, continuously monitor the Kubernetes cluster and synchronize the service registry with the current state of the cluster's resources.

ðŸ‘‰ VirtualServices: When you define a VirtualService in Istio, you specify the logical name of the destination service (e.g., "my-service"). Istio's control plane uses this information to resolve the destination service to the corresponding set of backend instances (pods) in the service registry.

ðŸ‘‰ Traffic Management: Based on the routing rules defined in the VirtualService, Istio's control plane configures the Envoy proxies with the necessary routing and traffic management policies. This includes routing requests to the appropriate backend instances based on the configured rules.

ðŸ‘‰ Dynamic Updates: Istio's control plane continuously monitors changes in the service registry and updates the Envoy proxies dynamically to reflect any changes in the cluster's topology (e.g., scaling up/down of pods, changes in service endpoints).

***Suppose my application has three services ..shopping , booking and ticketing ..how can i apply a virtual service and destination rules for each service .. 
can we have a single virtual service and multiple destination rules here ?***

***How can i have two deployment of my service one running with v1 and another with v2 ..can you give an example of this ?***
 Let's create an example where we have two deployments of a shopping service, one running version v1 and the other running version v2, using Kubernetes Deployment objects.

Here's how you can define two deployments for the shopping service with different versions:

#### Define Deployment for Version v1:
Create a Kubernetes Deployment object for version v1 of the shopping service. This deployment will contain pods running the v1 version of your shopping service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shopping-service-v1
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shopping-service
      version: v1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shopping-service
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: shopping-service
        image: shopping-service:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
#### Define Deployment for Version v2:
Similarly, create another Kubernetes Deployment object for version v2 of the shopping service.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: shopping-service-v2
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: shopping-service
      version: v2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: shopping-service
        version: v2
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: shopping-service
        image: shopping-service:v2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
