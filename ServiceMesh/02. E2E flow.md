## How Istio's traffic management components work together

### Deployment of Services:
You deploy your microservices or applications into your Kubernetes cluster.
Each service is exposed via a Kubernetes Service object, which provides a stable DNS name and load balancing across the instances of the service.

### Istio Components:
Istio consists of several components that work together to manage traffic within the mesh:

#### Envoy Proxy: 
Istio uses Envoy as the data plane proxy to intercept and control traffic between services. Each service instance has an Envoy sidecar proxy deployed alongside it.
####  Pilot: 
Pilot is Istio's control plane component responsible for configuring the Envoy proxies and distributing service discovery information.

#### Citadel: 
Citadel is Istio's security component responsible for managing certificates and providing mutual TLS authentication between services.

#### Service Registration:
When you deploy your services, Istio's Pilot component monitors the Kubernetes API server for changes to service endpoints.
Pilot collects service endpoint information and generates configuration for the Envoy proxies deployed alongside each service instance.

#### DestinationRules:
DestinationRules define policies that apply to traffic intended for a specific service.
You define DestinationRules to specify subsets of a service (e.g., based on labels such as version labels).
Each subset can have its own traffic routing and traffic policies.

#### VirtualServices:
VirtualServices define the routing rules for traffic within the mesh.
You define VirtualServices to map incoming requests to specific subsets of services based on criteria such as HTTP paths, headers, or source IP addresses.
VirtualServices can also define traffic shifting, retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking behavior.

#### Configuration Distribution:
Once you define VirtualServices and DestinationRules, Pilot distributes the configuration to the Envoy proxies deployed alongside each service instance.
Envoy proxies dynamically update their configuration based on changes received from Pilot.

#### Traffic Routing:
When a client sends a request to a service, the request first reaches the Envoy proxy deployed alongside the client's service.
The Envoy proxy inspects the request and consults its configuration to determine how to route the request.
Based on the routing rules defined in the VirtualService, the Envoy proxy forwards the request to the appropriate destination service and subset.

#### Circuit Breaking:
If a service experiences failures or high latency, the circuit breaker configured in the DestinationRule can open, preventing further requests from being forwarded to that service.
Envoy proxies monitor the health of the services they communicate with and enforce circuit breaking policies accordingly.

#### Security:
Citadel manages the security aspects of communication within the mesh, including mutual TLS authentication between services.
Envoy proxies enforce TLS encryption and certificate verification for all traffic between services.
