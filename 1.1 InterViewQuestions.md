# 1. How do Pods communicate in Kubernetes?
ðŸ‘‰ In Kubernetes, each Pod has an IP address. A Pod can communicate with another Pod by directly addressing its IP address, but the recommended way is to use Services. A Service is a set of Pods, which can be reached by a single, fixed DNS name or IP address.

**Step1**: Create the Pod and give it a label - The Pod is usually created through another object like a Deployment, a StatefulSet, or, in OpenShift, a DeploymentConfig. The Pod is assigned a the label in its JSON or YAML, like app: api.

**step2**: Create a Service which selects the backend Pod - A Service is created which selects all Pods that match the given label. This is done by specifying a selector in the Service definition. In this example, the Service is called my-api and it selects Pods with the label app=api.

**Step3**: The app communicates with the backend using the service name as the hostname - The app can now address the API using the Service name as the hostname. So if the app talks to the backend over HTTP then it would look like http://my-api:8080.

If the Pods die, or they need to be restarted, this wonâ€™t affect the app, because it will still communicate with the API pods via the Service, which has a stable IP address.

# 2. How do containers in the same Pod communicate?

Multiple containers in the same Pod share the same IP address. They can communicate with each other by addressing localhost. For example, if a container in a Pod wants to reach another container in the same Pod on port 8080, it can use the address localhost:8080.

Because multi-container Pods share the same IP address and communicate on localhost, this means that two containers canâ€™t share the same port, if theyâ€™re in the same Pod.

# what's the difference between Deployment and Replica set?
>Both replica set and deployment have the attribute replica: 3, what's the difference between deployment and replica set? Does deployment work via replica set under the hood?

**Answer:** 

A deployment is a higher abstraction that manages one or more replicasets to provide controlled rollout of a new version.

Lets say you use ReplicaSet-A for controlling your pods, then You wish to update your pods to a newer version, now you should create Replicaset-B, scale down ReplicaSet-A and scale up ReplicaSet-B by one step repeatedly (This process is known as rolling update). Although this does the job, but it's not a good practice and it's better to let K8S do the job.

A Deployment resource does this automatically without any human interaction and increases the abstraction by one level.

Note: Deployment doesn't interact with pods directly, it just does rolling update using ReplicaSets.
